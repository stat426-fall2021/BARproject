Joke-Honest,"I have a 5 week old. I know it's still really early on, but I can't stand the way my body looks and feels. I hate the pooch that I now have thanks to the emergency c section, the weight I put on, the way my breasts feel because I'm nursing. 
I can't look at older pictures of me without wanting to sob. I don't even feel like I'm in my own body half the time, I barely ever feel ""present"".
On my worst days all I want to do is hand my son to my husband and slit my wrists, or OD on the oxycodone I never took for my pain.

RareCandyMama,"If you watch the show 911 then this has a small spoiler from last week's episode.

I've been struggling with postpartum depression since my son was born and I've recently started counseling and upped my dose for my antidepressant. My husband has seemed really supportive and trying to be there for me but I realized this morning that he doesn't understand and I don't think he will. 

We were watching 911 and one of the characters recently had a baby and the mom was really struggling with PPD. She ended up quitting her job because she's struggling too much and feeling like she isn't enough. The whole scene resonated with me to my core. The feelings of overwhelming sadness and guilt and feeling like I'm not ever going to be enough for my family, I feel all of that and more.

We've talked about it plenty and I thought he was understanding but after the episode, he said that he doesn't know how anyone could get so lost in their depression that they quit their job. And that he used to feel depression but he changed his outlook and now he's better. He said that he doesn't like what they are doing with her character because he doesn't see her as the type to have depression. The episode was like looking to a mirror for me, seeing all that I have been feeling reflected in her character. 

I feel invisible and invalidated... I dont know if he was only being superficially supportive and hoping that I would just bounce back to before PPD or if he was truly trying to help. I dont know what to say to him anymore...",Postpartum_Depression,SO doesn't understand,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/nok06s/so_doesnt_understand/,1622432278.0,2021-05-30 20:37:58,

I was suffocating from the chest tightness I was feeling. I was tired of being a mother. I still am. I’m over it. I’m tired of having no freedom, of not recognizing who I am, no sleep, feeling hopeless, feeling so disconnected from the world. I don’t feel the connection or bond people say you feel when you have a child and that makes me feel bad but it’s true.

I wish I could see the light at the end of the tunnel but I can’t.

This newborn stage is not fun, I’m ready for him to grow up (I know I’ll regret that but I am). I want to wake up and not have my life anymore.

soft_warm_purry,"With my PPD I get triggered easily by whining and crying when it’s at higher frequencies, and I have to restrain my urge to hit or throw things. It’s frustrating because one of my kids has a higher more nasal whine and even though his brother whines just as much sometimes it doesn’t trigger me at all bc his voice is lower. It’s very odd. 

Just tried these incredible in ear plugs that are designed to just reduce the distortion and annoyance of certain frequencies without blocking out noise so I can still respond to the kids, and it’s been amazing!

RubyRain05,"Feeling isolated even in a house full of people. My husband wfh, my mom is retired and my dad still works, then theres me SAHM, and baby.

I've attempted to sleep train and we are good at bedtime but MOTN have been difficult. We try different things then shes back to waking and not going back to sleep. Husband has been waking to put her back to sleep so I can rest but it's not working well. He weaned her cold turkey from night feeds and it's like shes still fighting for it 3 weeks later. So instead of me resting I still have to go in and help sometimes.

Tonight she cried for almost 2 hours until my husband had to get ready for work and I had to step in. I couldn't get her to sleep but she was finally calm so I put her down like bedtime and left and 1 min later she started crying. Now everyone came after ME for it. I've told everyone countless times why I want to let her CIO at night but they say no because they can't hear her cry and need sleep and its cruel....how is that any different than now. 

I go into a rage when I'm sleep deprived and they all come at me at once at 4 am about what is wrong with ST. All day I'm with her and I'm expected to be up all night too and keep the house clean. My mom is sick so she spends most of the day sleeping or in pain. Husband works but then gets upset if I leave her with him to long right after work plus he insists on his early 6:30 bedtime in order wake at 4am with her. I'm exhausted and trying so hard to keep my energy up for her shes 12m. But I need more support from the people around me..they might as well not be there. I feel like a piece of crap that no one cares about. 

A big thing contributing to my depression is I did get my wfh dream job 4 months pp but it only lasted 4 months and I feel like I failed. They didn't say the problem was me (although I suspect they legally weren't allowed to becaus I was a new mom) and I just wish I would have had better support and regret so many things I did while working distracted. What hurts more is when I asked for MOTN help when I was working my husband refused. And now he wants to complain to me about being tired and working....yea I know....🙄. Adding salt to the wound is him saying I'm not emotionally meeting her needs especially because I want to sleep train. This guy told me 10 days PP that I wasn't doing enough for her because I was trying to split the night with him so I can sleep at 8 and jump in for the early wakes! He was on paternity leave so what's the problem with that??! 

I just want the saga to end! I'm tired of explaining myself and not being respected because it's not just about me so I guess I have no say. I had to scream.at them to leave me.alone.

I immediately bonded with my son. Love at first site, literally. Breastfed most of his life (still nursing at 16 mons) and we've bedshared since he was born. Its making me question who I am as a mother? How can I be a good parent to one of my babies, and literally not wanna touch the other one???? 

anyways the real reason im making this post is, im worried im gonna traumatize my daughter and that shes gonna pick up on my feelings for her. i know shes a little baby soon &amp; im really really hoping this goes away before she can form sentences and pays attention to what im saying. 

my mom didnt like me either as a kid, she would tell me all the time. I was so excited to be having a girl to finally break the curse in my family of mothers not liking their daughters. i know i still struggle as an adult with the kinds of things my mom said to me or did to me as a child &amp; i would never ever wanna put someone else let alone MY BABY through that kind of stuff.

rubymars17,"I’m a new mom almost 4 months pp. Recently has been diagnosed with PPA and moderate PPD by a psychiatrist. I love my baby so so much. When she smiles, I smile.

Now Almost nothing can lighten my mood up. ......I constantly feel like a loser. I keep questioning myself more and more. And everything is triggering my anxiety.

Dancing was one of my hobbies before pregnancy. But now I have this leg pain PP so I couldn’t dance. I’m going to physical therapy every week. The PT said it’s normal and it will heal. But I’m just worried too much and I ask her every week “will I get better will I get better?”. This triggers my anxiety as well.

Sometimes even a message from my friend triggers my anxiety. So I have this friend who is a workaholic keeps messaging me about her feelings, her pressure doing her job and etc. I know she is my friend and I should be supportive but all I want to say is will you just shut up!

Sndzc,"Hello everyone, I've been reading some stories and I will share mind as I think I need some help.

I am gonna try to keep this short but there is a lot. My now husband and I met overseas and we are from two different countries (France and US). After two years in the country we met we had to leave pretty quickly for private reasons (it was quite traumatic). Before the move we had a few hard months, suffered a miscarriage while being away from friends and family and I lost a lot of weight because of stress and anxiety (I have been struggling with my body and eating habits since being a teenager).

We made it back to each other countries and I visited him while waiting for my visa to move permanently to the US. After almost a year and being few weeks away from my visa interview, we decided to try for a baby so I can be pregnant and not work (and hopefully relax) during the full pregnancy and the first few months of the baby as it will take a while to get my work authorization. The plan was good on paper but covid happened, my interview was 3 days after the world went in full lockdown and it got cancelled. So here I am pregnant, in lockdown by myself thinking it will be only for a little bit. During the lockdown my mom sold her apartment I was living at and didnt really care where I will end up (she had her life going on in Portugal and didnt even bothered to come for the move). Luckily, my grand ma whom I am very close to still has the big family house and I moved there along with my cousin. I spend a ""relaxing"" spring and summer there with them but as I was going closer to my due date I was starting to get very anxious my partner will not be able to make it on time. Luckily he was working remotely and his company was nice enough to let him travel and work from France from September (after almost 24h of travel because of so many restrictions to enter France). We got to enjoy a month of getting ready for our baby in our rental and life felt normal again. However we knew that shortly after the birth we will have to get all the paperwork for me and our baby to be able to fly home to the US. And we did, one week after birth (which was a non scheduled home birth, baby girl was excited to meet us!), traveled to Paris to take care of passport and visa. I had to do a medical for my visa and the doctor checked my weight and nicely told me that I had ""a long way to go"" before being back to my pre pregancy weight(remember the body image issues I mentioned ? It was very helpful). Anyways, we are finally on our way after a stressful month as I needed to take care of many other paperwork as I was leaving my country, packing, nursing my baby, lack of sleep etc etc.

Once in the US, we moved into my partner's apartment (1 bed 1 bath) and for a month or so we are still busy with paperwork, unpacking etc. My visa was linked to us getting married so we did got married in December but because of COVID it was only my in laws, our baby girl at the city office (not really the wedding of my dreams). We were supposed to have our religious wedding this summer in France but this got cancelled because of covid too.

January to March has been very hard. I had ups and downs with breastfeeding (reynaud's disease and a lot of pain), couldnt manage to loose any weight, was over tired, felt very isolated because I have no friends and family around + covid so no outlets to meet new people (my dad couldn't even meet his first granddaughter because we had to leave France so quickly). I found myself somedays just sleeping all day long and waking up only to feed our daughter. I felt I was failing her as mom as I was mostly a robot. My husband was trying to help but he is not naturally proactive and it was starting to be too much for me to have to think about everything for the family.

After 4 months in our cave (the place had no light, my husband worked from our living room and i had basically no space to be), we finally moved to a bright and sunny place with two bedrooms. We were thinking this will help me a lot because now I have natural light, a space for my indoor bike so I can workout more consistently, etc etc. However, it has been now a month in the new place and I find myself still not feeling normal if I can say so. The body acception part of postpartum is super super hard for me. My marriage pictures are one month postpartum and I just can't look at it. Even yesterday's picture taken at a family gathering are so hard for me to look at because I just don't look like myself. I went to have a haircut to refresh my look and take care of myself but even that made me feel worst as I didn't recognise myself. I am trying to take it easy but I just feel it has been too much for the last two years. I try to talk to my doctor at my postpartum check here in the US but I just couldn't say a word, I had tears in my eyes but just couldn't talk. I felt I was doing better but I will find myself breaking down for minor things and I cannot take any pressure anymore.

At yesterday's gathering, I just felt i didn't belong there, had nothing to talk about, not even mentioning people asking about a second child when my first is only 7 months (I initially wanted a big family but this post partum phase is a huge setback for me).

I want to talk to psychiatrist but I am afraid to be put on meds but at the same time I feel I need something to help my brain relax for a little. I feel my husband is worried for me and afraid I will just leave them or breakdown because it is just too much for me.

My english is bad sorry. I'm just lazy.
Anyways. I have a 3 1/2 month old baby girl who adores me. She was born a preemie. And a badass 2 month old toddler who makes so much mess through the day. Especially with food like c'mon man. 
I'm a work from home mom with dad working out of town monday- saturday. It's been 3 weeks of this and he lowkey wants to make it into more. Whatever the deal is. I am very suddenly and severely declining in my depression and delusional thoughts. I am bipolar II with psychosis and anxiety. Anyways
I've been stuck in an endless loop of depressive thoughts that trace back to my self hate inflicted coming from a household with plenty mental issues then the gap between then and now feels non existential, y'all get it. 
I find being alone a trigger. I feel so empty in every way. 
Like everything had a meaning, but then no meaning at all. Whatsoever.
No emotional attachment to things I enjoy and cherish when my husbands home. Everything is just particles.  I lose sense of time sometimes I even forget I have kids or a job. I forget who I am. How I look. Every time I look at myself I see different features. I forget to eat. I impulsively deleted all my social media I mean I didn't have any friends either. I don't like to feel people developing a friendship with me. I've stayed in the same apartment 3 weeks and it feels like I'm in a mental hospital. Constantly having flashbacks of all my times institutionalized. Mostly of my younger years where I would go to same ward and I was put in empty room with a camera. I honestly feel like I died and I'm a tumbleweed somewhere in a desert. I honestly don't even know how I'm performing hygiene on me and the kids and feeding time for them.

She's older now and calmer, only 11 weeks old, but still I don't feel as desperate as I had when she does get fussy. This is all because I have been on zoloft for a few weeks now and have been getting help from family. I stayed with my MIL for two weeks straight recently. All of this has been helping me fight postpartum depression. And because I am fighting it, I see how much I actually love being her mommy and love being around her.

I had extreme back pain and muscle spasms during my third trimester, so bad I had to stop working around 34 weeks pregnant. But even though it was extremely painful for me to walk or do any physical activity, I was still expected to do everything I did before (plus some, since now I was off work and therefore had more free time). I had to keep up with the grocery shopping, carrying the groceries upstairs to our second floor apartment without help, cooking, packing SO's lunch for work, cleaning the house, dishes, laundry, etc. 

I went to the hospital May 10th to induce labor. I have horrible anxiety, especially around doctors and hospitals. My labor was really scary since this is my first baby and I was in labor for 24 hours. They almost did an emergency c-section, even had me sign all the paperwork because they were so sure they were going to have to do a c-section. I was awake all night unable to sleep because I was so scared and nervous. SO was asleep for most of it, and on his phone most of the time he wasn't sleeping. I was in charge of updating friends and family members about what was going on, and after our son was born I was still in charge of updates, pictures, etc for my parents, his parents, our friends, Facebook, you name it. I felt like I didn't get much of a chance to just enjoy my son.

After we came home from the hospital, I was told not to lift or carry anything heavier than my baby. I was told to take it easy, and not overdo it. Basically, just take care of the baby and myself and that's it. I wanted to listen to the doctor's advice, but that hasn't happened yet. Ever since the day we came home, I've had to go back to my regular activity from before giving birth. All the housework, cooking, etc plus keeping all friends and family updated. My son is the first grandchild on both mine and my SO's side of the family, and everyone wanted pictures and info and I was to do it all. I was and still am bleeding too much, definitely wasn't getting a chance to shower as often as I should and keep my stitches clean, hell I barely have time to change out my pad or go pee when I need to. I went to the store the day I came home from the hospital, 3 days after giving birth, because we needed formula and I'm the one in charge of doing the shopping. 

So, needless to say, I'm beyond overwhelmed and stressed out. I have major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis (my psychiatrist is working with me to figure out exactly what it is but I hear voices in my head 24/7) and they warned me I'd probably have PPD after I had my son. I'm definitely feeling like I have it but I also don't know who I can talk to. I haven't started talk therapy yet, don't have any friends, and for a few months now I haven't been able to talk to my partner about how I feel without regretting it. 

I need tips on how to handle post partum depression by myself. What can I do that doesn't involve reaching out to a friend or family member, since that's not really an option for me? What can I do to take care of myself when I have a never ending to-do list and no time to eat or pee much less do any form of self-care? I feel like I'm drowning and really need some advice.

Erbear1,"I am already in therapy, and have been seeing my therapist for general depression since before I was pregnant with my son (18 months old). I am also on 100mg of zoloft per day. I don't feel as though my depression has gotten any better, only that I'm managing. 

Is this how I'm going to feel for the rest of my life? Like I'm constantly just managing the symptoms. Is there anything I can be doing at home to make myself get better? Is there a such thing as better with PPD? I journal every day but I'm finding it hard because I just feel like I am whining on the pages about how shitty I feel when objectively, my life is pretty great. 

I have an awesome kid, my husband is a fucking rockstar with how supportive he is, and yet I don't feel happy. At least not happy enough. All my happy feelings feel like they are lined with feelings of sadness. Will that ever go away, or will I just have to live with it?

boo-pspps,"I was induced at 38 weeks, my baby girl wasn’t growing. She ended up being in the posterior position so I had to get forceps. It was a medium traumatic experience. 

But my milk came late and when we were in hospital I had nothing to give her, we had to give her formula. I felt like a failure. When she would cry cry cry at night I would say to my husband “let’s leave her here”. I said it as a joke but I knew deep down I was serious. I felt worse… 

When I left the hospital I went to stay with my parents who kindly offered to help. My husband is a gold star husband who does everything he can to make things easier for me. But I was sad all the time, I felt like a bad mum because I didn’t have enough milk to feed her. I was sleep deprived all the time, I was exhausted. 

My husband noticed this and he held me as I cried and said to me I should call my doctor and talk to her about how I was feeling. He knew something was wrong. I was like a different person. The strong independent woman he married was nowhere to be seen. I was a mess! But I ignored him. 

A few more weeks in I found myself crying everyday. My mum saw me one day and asked me “what do you have to be sad about? You have a great husband, a healthy baby. Don’t be so negative.” 

That night i cried myself to sleep. I woke at 3 am to feed. After hubby helped me feed our little baby girl I found myself thinking about packing a bag and just leaving. I didn’t feel like I was worthy to be a mum, and my hubby and baby would be better off without me. In that moment something triggered in my brain I realised something was very wrong. In a moment of clarity my normal self took over and made a booking online to talk to my GP. She diagnosed me with a mild case of PND. 

This was 2 months ago. 
I still struggle sometimes. Ive begged my husband through tears and screams to let me go. I’ve begged him to find our baby a new mum, a better mum, someone who could care for her. The whole time he would hold me and say to me gently but firmly i am the best mum for our baby. Sometimes his voice would cut through the depression, other times it doesn’t. 

I am improving though, finding things that helps me manage my symptoms. Im not on any medication yet, but im learning to talk about it with friends. I find talking about really helps me. I don’t tell my parents about it because they don’t understand depression. 

Most of the time though I feel guilty about having postnatal depression…. 

I have a wonderful and supportive husband who is an amazing dad, very hands on. My baby girl is growing and every medical professional we have seen have commented on how healthy she is. I have a good job, my work has paid parental leave, my husband also gets paid parental leave. My managers at work have given me all the power to decide when I return to work and how flexibly I want to work when I’m ready. 

What do I have to be sad about?? I should be happy, but I’m not. Im grateful for what I have I truly am. But sometimes I feel so guilty for feeling sad because I really have no reason to.

incognito536,"I have a 2 year old son and I was diagnosed with PPD/PPR at 6 months postpartum. My son can be downright rotten. I know, I know, it’s the terrible 2’s, but he’s been like this since birth. I often say (and truly believe) that my son is the most difficult child to ever be conceived. As a baby, he cried for hours every day. Couldn’t be put down for even a second. Needed constant stimulation. Nursed constantly. Never slept. He was up 6-10 times a night until we finally sleep trained at 13 months. And even now, he sometimes screams for hours before falling asleep at night, and per our pediatrician’s advice, we let him. He’s broken me entirely.

He doesn’t do anything. Can’t drive 10 minutes down the road to the grocery store (to the point that I’ve been off my depression meds for over a week because I can’t get to the store to pick up the refill; he won’t tolerate the ride there). Refuses to eat (gets angry when we put food on his plate and angrily throws it all at me/around the room). Won’t tolerate the wagon or the stroller. Refuses to play (just throws his toys at me in anger). Shows no affection whatsoever. Spends all day hitting, slapping, scratching, pulling hair and screaming. We’ve taken him to every specialist under the sun and he’s perfectly healthy, but I’m losing my grip.

I feel genuine hatred for my child. I’m completely miserable, and spiraling out of control. On a regular basis, I tell my husband (while my child is within earshot) that my son makes me miserable. That if something happened to him and I didn’t have to deal with him anymore, it wouldn’t be all bad because at least I’d get my life back. That I hate my child. And today, I grabbed his arm and yelled at him to stop screaming and crying and just be a normal kid. I was not nice about it. Sometimes, I put him on the ground too roughly after a bout of slapping and scratching. All I do is yell and cry. I’m terrified I’m abusing my child both emotionally and physically.

I’m currently seeing multiple therapists. I’ve been on every medication and combination of medications you could possibly think of, and nothing is getting better. Things are only getting much worse. I don’t know what to do anymore. My child is miserable and mean, but he deserves better. I grew up in an abusive home and I promised myself I’d do better. I’d be a gentle parent. But he’s broken me and I’ve lost myself entirely. What do I do? Do I tell someone he’s being abused and let them take him away? I want him to be happy and safe. I love him and I want better for him.

nosihctuhalya,"i should preface this entire post with saying i didnt want a second baby to begin with. i was 100% content with my 6.5 month old at the time when i found out i was pregnant again. 
i was already diagnosed with postpartum depression about a week ago by a psychiatrist. im now seeing a therapist for the 1st time next week. ive just been struggling super hard with bonding and to even just like my daughter in general. i know that sounds horrible but ill explain 

so my son was born jan 2020. hes almost 16 mons currently. my experience delivering him was the most traumatic thing ive ever gone thru to date. he was 10 lbs, gave me 4th degree tears and needed 4 blood transfusions. however he had no issues upon arrival and was placed directly into my arms and he's been breastfed pretty much every day since. it was like love at first site for us.

my daughter was born march 2021 (due april) my water broke with her way to early and the dr at my local hospital had me transferred to a bigger hospital with a NICU. she was born and was having issues breathing on her own and regulating her own sugars so she stayed in there for a week. i didnt even get to hold her til she was 3-4 days old. it was awful. 

so now im paying the price for that nicu visit. i feel like shes someone elses baby and im just the long term babysitter. i literally dread waking up to feed her, holding her, listening to her coos. all of that stuff makes me unimaginably angry? my therapist is supposed to work with me threw that and the mom guilt of taking attention away from my son too early. 

i just need to know if its normal to not like or wanna hold your baby. i experienced the opposite of this problem with my son. i could never put him down or let him cry. he was exclusively breastfed for nearly 14 mons. i didnt even wanna pump or latch her. which struck me as weird bc i was so against giving my son formula. a week after my daughter came home she was pretty much only on formula, i stopped pumping and latching her cuz i didnt wanna hold her. 

i guess im just looking for support and honesty. i am struggling and just need to not feel so alone.",Postpartum_Depression,struggling to bond w/ infant,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/ngxfvm/struggling_to_bond_w_infant/,1621534503.0,2021-05-20 11:15:03,

Investment_Routine,"I’m a little over a week postpartum. I feel fine SOMETIMES. The rest of the time I feel alone. I have my baby, my fiancé and dog. I love them all to death, even though I’m with them all the time I still feel alone. My dad committed suicide earlier this year while I was pregnant and it was the hardest thing I had to go through. Ever since I haven’t been myself. I tell everyone around me I’m okay but I’m really not. 

I get so overwhelmeded when my baby cries, I’m a first time mom so I’m still learning all the baby actions and cries. I lose so much sleep and that obviously doesn’t help with depression. 

Overall I feel like I do so much for everybody and nobody does anything for me. I sell my personal belongings when we are low on money to support my family and I never get anything in return. For once I want someone to say I’m doing a good job.

Flybyraven,"Im 3 weeks postpartum and had a pretty traumatic birth of my second child and then the 2 weeks following were very stressful. Our daughter swallows a bunch of fluid when she was born and it caused various issues and didn’t allow me to see her for almost 8 hours after she was born and delayed breastfeeding. Then she had such high levels of jaundice that we were admitted to the children’s hospital ER several times. 
While all this was going on I wasn’t able to take very good care of myself and developed a severe UTI I mistook for postpartum symptoms. 
On top of all the stress and worry I’m also struggling with caring for a newborn and my toddler, I feel like I never get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time and I rarely get to sleep during the day. I lose my patience with my toddler and I feel horrible, it feels like I am a horrible mother.

WontYouSee,"How wrong could I have gotten a decision?
How much more wrong could I possibly be in my thoughts of what I would be as a mother?
I knew I should never have a child. I knew that I should never have a child but I went and did it anyway and now look at all of the pain, look at all of the suffering I have caused.

I always knew I was too sensitive, too wrapped up in my own issues, too mentally unhealthy and emotionally retarded to have a child. I didn’t want them to inherit my suffering. I knew that I should never have a child, it wouldn’t be fair on them.

And now here I am, I somehow managed to convince myself that I could do it and that it would be nice and fine. I convinced myself I could be a mother. Hahahaha. What a fucking joke!

I’m nothing, I’m nothing but a selfish vacuum that brings pain and hurt to all of those things that are near her. 

And now my baby, who never asked to be brought here, who never asked to have all of this happen screams at me. He stares me right in the eyes as he screams at me: “why the hell did you bring me here, you monster!?” I can see the pain in his face, see the fear in his eyes, feel the suffering, his soul is on fire, he is burning thanks to me.

Before I had a baby I knew that I was sensitive to noise. I didn’t know that the sound of my baby screaming would shoot like hot lightning through my brain and down the back of my neck either paralysing me or sending me into blackout rage. I didn’t know the sound of my baby crying would make me want to gouge out my eyes and stab myself in the wrists or walk off a ledge. I didn’t know that the sound of my baby crying would reverberate through my whole body, punching me over and over again in the guts: “why did you do this?”, “you knew you shouldn’t have done this!”, “look what you’ve done you fucking idiot, look at my suffering!” 

I never knew that I would be screaming along with my baby in the darkest hours of night, I didn’t know I would be pulling him close and telling him I hate him, telling him I’m going to fucking kill him. He is being punished, he is being blamed for all of MY mistakes, like it’s somehow his fault that he cries, like it’s somehow his fault that I don’t know how to do this.

He did nothing, he did nothing to deserve this. He did nothing to deserve copping me for a mum. And now I get to sit back and watch a completely pure and innocent being slowly get more and more damaged, more and more broken, more and more hurt because of my stupidity.

teresaistired,"Around the time I was a baby myself, I was exposed to a motherly figure who was...incredibly contradictory, to say the least. She would show me periods of extreme affection and then began to verbally abuse me and my parents. She had more influence on me than I can put into words. She died during childbirth, giving birth to a boy who has now grown into a man. To say we were best friends is an understatement, and...he got me pregnant, fathering my own children.

Now that a few days have passed by since I gave birth to two perfect, tiny, helpless, perfect, beautiful twin boys, and I'm tumbling headlong into the postpartum stage. And the dysphoria I feel from all of this is...incredible. Most of the time, I feel like I should be dead, like her. Sometimes, I feel I've triumphed over her, surviving what she couldn't. Sometimes, I feel like I'm worse than her by surviving what she couldn't. And...hell, most of the time. I don't even know what to feel. I just want to leave this body and parent my beautiful babies from a distance, no matter how much it hurts. You know? (Probably not.)

mompostpartum,"My birth was traumatic to say the least... but I’ll do my best to keep it short. I was in labor for about 24 hours and I pushed for over 3 while my baby had been in distress for around 8 hours of my labor and the duration of pushing. So once we decided an emergency c-section was necessary I was relieved to have my baby here and safe. He was stuck and they had to go up into the vaginal cavity and push him out the incision. He came out not crying &amp; blue and it was the longest 2 minutes of my entire life waiting to hear that cry while they suctioned him and flipped him around trying to get him breathing. After all of that I was just glad he was finally here. 5 days postpartum I had a fever, chills and my incision was red and puffy. I went to the emergency department and was told I had an infection and was septic, they admitted me immediately for intense iv antibiotics after 36 hours of antibiotics and no improvement and some allergic reactions they decided to open me again and remove the infection by scraping it out of my abdomen. 3 days post surgery I was sent home and my husband had to return to work the next day. During the 3 weeks after I had to return to the emergency department 3 more times cause the incision was reopening and gaping in on spot. When my baby was 5 weeks my grandmother had to get surgery (she was terminally ill with liver disease) the surgery didn’t go as planned... she bled and needed a transfusion. She was in icu and her kidneys weren’t functioning at the right percentage and she was combative with nurses and heavily sedated. She wasn’t expected to live and was VERY uncomfortable. She came home on hospice and passed 2 days later. My husband wasn’t very helpful around the house and I feel like I didn’t get to grieve cause I had to do everything without any help or support.

We were going through a rough time and she didn’t feel I was giving her the love I need.

I had recently stepped up and was doing a lot better with the baby and the other three children. My girlfriend wrote me a 5 page letter saying how proud she was and how she wanted us to work on things and go to therapy together and give ourselves a happy life.

That night she got off work around 11pm and walked out. Just like that. She’s been gone for almost a month now and has refused to talk to me one on one about what’s going on. She’s been working constantly and picking up extra shifts and when she does have days off she goes out of town with friends.

lanalou1313,"I've been a mum for 1961 days today. 

On Boxing Day 2015, my[My first days in the motherhood](https://imgur.com/gallery/nN2WaIb) little diva came squealing into my world, changing everything forever. During my pregnancy, I'd known that she was medically complex, and that she would need indefinite time in hospital/s and at least one surgery on her heart (she ended up having two, six weeks apart). I'd known that she had down syndrome, I'd known since 13 weeks into my pregnancy. I'd known that I'd be doing it as a single parent, solely responsible for this little life I was growing inside me. 

What I didn't know, and what I wish I'd known, was how difficult those first few months were going to be. It started the night she was born. I had an emergency c-section, and it was hands down one of the most surreal experiences of my life. I could feel pulling and tugging, and a sort of 'schlooop' feeling when they pulled her out, and then the most amazingly beautiful and heartbreaking squeal I've ever heard in my life. This first picture in this collage is the first time I saw her, she was so small and pink. Her lips kept puckering up like a little rosebud. I didn't get to hold her that first night, she was too fragile and needed to kept very warm. The second picture is one my brother took as the nurses were wheeling her past him to the PICU, one he texted to me right away. Not being able to hold her that first night was very hard. It felt unreal, like I was an imposter, who hadn't just given birth to her first, her only, child. The nurse I had that night was a saint. He was funny, caring, and so good at his job. I can't even remember his name or what he looked like (which is interesting, because he had his hands on my nipples more than anyone before, or since). The third photo is about 12 hours post birth, finally getting to hold her, to look at her properly, for the first time. The love and fear that welled up in those first few minutes has never left my body since. They are eternally linked in a leaderless dance, whirling together at the forefront of my feelings for my daughter. The last picture is one a good friend took, catching me at a moment when I was trying to articulate how I felt - love, overwhelming all consuming love, and fear. Terror, in fact - that I'd be a terrible mum and a let down to my beautiful Alice. 

It took me a solid six months to bond with my daughter after she was born. Sure, I was there, I was at the hospital as often a I could be. I was there, at meetings with doctors, nurses, social workers, nameless faceless masses all wanting a piece of me. Or a piece of Alice. I was taking pictures, I was gushing on social media about her, I was saying all the right things. But inside, there was a disconnect. I held her as little as possible, at the time telling myself it was because I didn't want to disturb her monitoring equipment. I would let the professional cuddlers do the hard work of comforting, connecting, with her. I would let her cry, waiting for the nurses to come in and comfort her. There was a time when I couldn't look back on those first few months without an immense sense of shame and guilt. I've come to realise that, after a life of protecting myself, my emotions, out of necessity, my mind (brain? Subconscious?) had created a wall between me and the source of the greatest fear in my life: my daughter. I faked my way through this first few months, through her wins and losses. Her surgeries. She had two open heart surgeries, the first of which was when she was only 6 weeks old - only one week past her due date. This first surgery was a stop-gap, an attempt to buy more time before the big surgery was necessary. It didn't work. The second surgery, the make or break procedure to get her heart and lungs functioning properly, was done to her when she was 13 weeks old. She weighed just 5.5kg, her heart was the size of a walnut. I remember very little of that day, save for the phone call from her surgeon telling me that the surgery was successful. Beyond the first ten seconds of that call, I remember nothing. 

Once she started recovering from the second operation, it was like a switch had been flicked inside me. I was allowed to love her now, I was allowed to let her in. In the snare of tangled vines connecting emotion to action, my brain hadn't allowed me to fully love her because of the fear of losing her. That, illogically, if I loved her less then it would hurt less if she died. It's taken me some time to come to terms with my actions and emotions those first few months, and a lot of hours with my psychologist to heal the wounds left by my guilt. 

This was my personal brand of post partum depression and anxiety. It manifests differently for everyone, triggered by things not always easily understood. For me, connecting with my girl will be a lifelong effort on my part. A lifelong commitment to engage with her and allow her love to flow through me. I'm a solitary person by nature, and don't easily let people past my galvanized, fortified walls. She seems to knock them down fairly effortlessly these days, for which I am entirely, and overwhelmingly, grateful.

loveoflyla,"So, I have bipolar disorder and am in remission, I also have PTSD.. nothing ever cured my bipolar depression and eventually I quit medication and it sort of went away.

FewPaleontologist565,"The following takes place in May of 2014

I was diagnosed with postpartum depression with my DD, she was 4 months old at the time. I had just gotten my own place with my EH and DD. I thought that moving out of MIL’s &amp; SIL’s 2 bedroom apartment would stop the stress and harassment that they caused me but I was wrong. These individuals kept hounding me and stressing me out. I was struggling as a new mom and had very little support from EH. He always sided with MIL and SIL even when they were wrong. 

All three knew something was off so they pressured me to go to therapy when I wasn’t ready, that didn’t work out well at all. When things didn’t get better they demanded I go to a doctor and take Zoloft. When I started taking the zoloft I became worse. My EH demanded I constantly take care of the baby while he slept, so I was sleep deprived, stressed out from being a mom with ppd, and his family’s constant insistence that I was like him and suffered from bipolar disorder because I had unresolved trauma from my abusive parents…

Eventually due to all the stress and the Zoloft just not working along with a rather terrible therapist, I snapped and developed postpartum psychosis from it all. Instead of letting me sleep and helping me feel better, MIL and EH decided that the best thing for me was to go to a psych ward.

This was the wrong thing to do. Little fact, I have a major phobia of psych wards and anything regarding anything psychiatric regarding myself. Anyways, I remember when my MIL and EH were driving me there. I sat in the backseat next to my daughter and I didn’t want to go. I just needed to sleep and get off the Zoloft that I didn’t even want to take in the first place! I kept telling them I didn’t want to go but they didn’t stop the car, they didn’t take me home, they just kept driving there to the hospital.

When we got there I refused to get out, and while EH was out of the car, my MIL told me “either you go in willingly or I’ll make security drag you in.” This terrified me and I didn’t want my daughter to witness that as well as being concerned for my own safety against the security staff. I got out of the car reluctantly and we walked in. 

While we waited I kept saying how I didn’t want this, I kept voicing it, and when it was time to sign the papers I remember asking my mother in law if that is what she wanted, and she said yes so I signed the papers and they hauled me away.

I felt so ashamed and humiliated. They did the typical intake process and what made me extremely uncomfortable was being asked to remove all of my clothing. This made me so ashamed of my body and humiliated, as a rape survivor this was horrifying to me. They watched me as I got undressed and watched me as I dressed in these awful scrubs. I still hate the color of green and blue to this day because of the scrubs. 

When I got up to the ward, I saw the locked doors and panicked. I started to cry. I didn’t belong there, I needed to be at home with my daughter taking care of her. When I entered the ward I refused my medications and would do so throughout my stay. I was watched as I used a bathroom toilet, as I showered, I was never left alone and I felt humiliated. I had no sense of privacy at all, I wanted to see the doctor and get out that night. I was never really told the reason I was admitted. 

I begged to have my breast pump there because I was breastfeeding and becoming engorged. They denied me my pump due to safety concerns and gave me a shitty hand pump. It didn’t work the way I needed to, I remember sitting down on my bathroom in the ward and crying as my pump didn't work. My breastfeeding bond with my daughter was gone along with any closeness I felt towards my daughter. 

I kept begging to see the doctor and the nurse said “if you continue to push to see the doctor, you might be forced to stay longer” So they tried to get me to eat the next three days, I hardly ate at all. They gave us food but no utensils. I was so angry at my EH and MIL and I let them know that. I called and told them exactly how they betrayed me and my MIL gaslight the heck out of me. Denying my trauma and feelings.

I was so exhausted because I was terrified that I could never leave. I thought I’d never see my DD again. It was horribly depressing. They slapped a bullshit diagnosis of Bipolar type 2 disorder on me (which has been rejected by my current therapist), and started me on 300mg of Trileptal 2x a day. A prescription that my current GP was appalled that I was given as that is something he would never have given me at all even in that situation. 

Things at home weren’t easy, my DD was diagnosed as “failure to thrive” when I was breastfeeding her and supplementing with formula. I felt like a failure because I was following her doctor’s orders to the letter. When I spoke with the therapist at the ward, I told him of my situation with my DD and how I felt like a failure. This therapist, without even contacting my DD’s pediatricin, decided it would be appropriate to call CPS on me.

I called my EH to let him know what was going to happen, and the police showed up at my home. They ransacked it and told my EH that a caseworker would be by. That caseworker never came by… I was so hurt and betrayed that I sunk further into depression. I wanted out of there. After 3 days I was released and walked out to a bus stop with tickets to get home. I didn’t tell anyone I had gotten out. Not until I needed my  EH to pick me up from the bus stop I was dropped off at. 

Surprise Surprise, not only were EH and DD there but guess who was driving, MIL… I told her I just wanted to go home and be with DD, but no, my MIL insisted we go fill my trileptal prescription. So we went to Walmart and filled it. I was so spaced out but full of rage, I was close to needing to take a trileptal again but I decided not to. After we filled it out and got home, I wanted to be left alone and told my MIL to leave so I could be with my daughter. She refused to leave my home, she told me she needed to see me take the medication and I told her no. I told her the medication wasn’t for me, and she refused to leave me alone and wouldn’t stop talking to me. So I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. She still wouldn’t leave me alone so I went to the bedroom and called 911. 

They sent over two police officers, one spoke to my EH and MIL while the other spoke with me directly. He said that since my EH was on the lease, and that he wanted his mom there, she didn’t have to leave. 

The police left and shortly after my MIL left as well… The next two days were awful. My MIL and EH had decided, even before I got out of the ward, that the next two days that EH worked, I was not to be left alone. The first night my EH’s work friend’s wife watched my DD, against my will, while EH was at work. The second night my MIL watched DD, also once again against my will. For two days I was alone at night without my DD. The time I was separated from my DD destroyed my relationship with her. She was 4 months old then and is currently 7 years old now, I’ve never had a close relationship with her since all of this happened. 

As for my EH and I, we never truly recovered from that. I saw it as the ultimate betrayal, I asked him how he could do that to me, he said he was scared and let his mother take over the whole situation… We eventually divorced after having another child but in all reality the moment I stopped loving him and started hating him was the night I was admitted. 

I constantly tried to confront my MIL about how she betrayed my trust and my feelings but she constantly denied me my feelings and my trauma. She literally told me how no trust was broken. I’ve never hated her more.

Since all this, it took me 6 years to finally go to therapy with a wonderful therapist who has helped me process all this information, she agrees that I didn’t need to be in there and that MIL is very controlling. My GP did not agree with the trileptal at all being prescribed especially on a one time meeting. He and my therapist agree that I was gaslit by MIL and EH the whole time.

matcha_milfshake,"Hi everyone! I’m here to get some advice and perspective on what my husband is going through. I am currently 32 weeks pregnant with our first child, and he has been struggling immensely with antepartum depression and anxiety. He has individual counseling and we are also doing marriage counseling.

While it was planned, we got pregnant very quickly, considering I have fertility issues. He had a bad childhood, and thinks he will be an awful father just like his own. He thinks he will be financially irresponsible like his parents. He also just got medically discharged from the military, and the wonderful, well-paying job he had lined up has been delayed for several months. We moved back in with my parents in our home state.

While he is getting help (and thankfully is very willing to talk about his feelings), I feel like I’m at my own breaking point. I’m angry at him, even though I don’t want to be. I wake him up every morning, almost pulling him out of bed. I literally have to force him to change his underwear daily like he’s a child. He won’t clean anything unless I instruct him to do so. He starts twiddling and getting anxious when I ask him about baby gear, birth education, etc. He struggles to go places on his own without me with him. He worries about money constantly, but is too depressed and anxious to sit down and do a job search. He’s constantly complaining and ruminating about how bad everything is. What hurts most of all is that he will not have sex with me. Ever since my bump popped at 20 weeks, he says all he sees when he looks at me is the incoming responsibility of parenthood. Since I have gained a lot of weight during pregnancy (and have had a past history of anorexia) this hurts me immensely. He’s loved me from a size 4 to a size 10, but now that I’ve got the babu bump, he won’t touch me.

He’s usually my HERO, guys. I’M usually the one with mental health issues (anxiety and anorexia) that he has to console. And he’s damn amazing at it. Hell, he’s still amazing at it. But I am having the hardest time being patient with his pain. I selfishly want my husband back. Do any of you have words of wisdom? Or can you help me understand his feelings?",Postpartum_Depression,Husband has antepartum depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/n511kl/husband_has_antepartum_depression/,1620194855.0,2021-05-04 23:07:35,

my wife just called me after a couple of weeks of thinking and she knows that she wants to have another child too. she agrees with me that there are a lot of obstacles and then not having a child would have just been easier but she also knows that that's been the source of my anger and depression lately. 

so the next step we're thinking is to try and get a more stable house, fix the plumbing and kitchen. then it's get my nexplanon out and start trying again. 

I'm all at once excited and terrified. I'm excited to get to have another kid, but I'm terrified of what people will think. I'm already looked down upon for being such a young mom and I think that people might think that I'm a terrible mother for having another child when my mental health hasn't been great. but I'm working on it I'm on a med that's helping my depression another Med that's helping my anxiety. yes I know I'll have to stop my medication if I get pregnant because this medication is bad for the baby but I feel like I'm on the right track.

I know he is just a baby and they cry, but I feel so overwhelmed that I feel like I cannot take it anymore and have to set my baby in the crib to go into the other room and cry in frustration.

My dog keeps EATING THE GODDAMN FORMULA and I'm too tired to remember to put it up every time

I missed my therapy appt and she doesn't have openings until Thursday

My MIL needed me to supervise parenting time with her kid and I was 5 min late so she yelled and threw her phone (she's under a lot of stress so it's understandable) but it sent me into a HEAVY PTSD episode.

During parenting time we got into a discussion of first memories and I uncovered a VERY traumatic experience from when I was 3

My wife got called into work so instead of having a nice night like we planned I yet again am alone

I'm starting to feel like a single parent and there's nothing I can do about it. All of my friends are either too busy with school, live too far away, or don't have transportation.

I still have NO CLUE how to do this final paper for my intro to logic and critical thinking class and the professor is already 2 weeks late getting me into a group for the group project aspect so the highest grade I can even get is a 50% at this point.

k9nan,"Hello all, 
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Sorry for any grammar errors or misspelling in advance.... 

My wife had our son almost 7 weeks ago. Before this week it was all rainbows and butterflies. We were all on cloud nine with minimum amount of sleep, just going through the motions of raising our beautiful son. I have a 7 year old daughter from my first marriage. She lives with us full time as I have sole custody of her and her bio mom has zero visitation rights or any contact for that matter. A couple nights ago our daughter triggered my wife by saying she hurt my wife’s feelings because she isn’t her real mom. My daughter calls my wife her mom and loves and adores her like she is.... however after all said and done She meant that she isn’t her real mom but wishes she gave birth to her. Well long story short this comment triggered my wife into a very aggressive manner that’s been going on for a couple of days. She is now wanting to separate our family and move back home (we live thousands of miles away from our home of record). She is also saying she feels trapped because of me defending our 7 year old. The situation escalated and made a turn for the worst that is still going on. 

I am not sure if this is PFD as I have never witnessed or gone through anything like that. And if it is signs of PFD what can I do to help her.

giigglesRmine,"I’m 4 months postpartum today. I love my son more than anything or anyone I have ever loved. Around a month ago I quit my job to stay at home full time. Since baby won’t take a bottle and the separation anxiety kept me from enjoying my work like I used to. I was so happy to finally be able to stay home but then, my partner is always working and I’m home alone all day with baby. We have fun together I love reading, singing, napping, and playing together. But I miss being around other adults. But I don’t have any friends where I live, my mom is close by but I don’t like bugging her all the time. I want time with other adults, I want time with my partner, and I want time for myself. I thought being home would allow this but I feel like I’m standing still with the baby while everyone around us is moving moving moving. And I’m just watching. Then we’re having trouble with the neighbors and are going to end up moving soon because of them. I don’t want to move. I barely want to brush my teeth or eat or even watch tv. I don’t want to move. My partner got me an iPad after months of asking and talking about one so that I could start working on my art again, and possibly writing again. I finally have it and I have absolutely no motivation or inspiration. I was abused as a child and coped with things by disassociating and self harm, as a teenager I self medicated. When I got pregnant the self medication stopped. With pregnancy all the old traumas were somehow revived and I had to deal with that. And birth brought it’s own problems, it was like hello! You have unlocked new traumas! Enjoy postpartum anxiety and depression, you can’t really do anything about it because you’re going to be so enveloped in taking care of a newborn. And then only 2 months postpartum I returned to work. And my heart broke and hey, new shit to deal with. Each stage brings new trials. And with each one I find myself disassociating more and more. I know I should talk to someone, I have a referral from the hospital. But after all this time I just want this to be gone. How long do I have to fight this battle. Each time I think I finally have a handle on it something new happens. I feel so numb, isolated, tired. I feel like a blank crumpled piece of paper. And I hate it. I have always had depression, but at least before the pregnancy I knew who I was and where I stood. Now I just feel blank, empty and floating. I love my little cachèton, I love motherhood.

Justasmoltowngurl,"After a traumatic delivery I knew something was wrong but I wasn't sure what. I didn't feel bonded with my daughter but I was assured this was normal and it would come with time. The first two weeks I didn't get to be with her much, I was readdmited to the ER with an infection and my husband and I didn't want her admitted so she could be with me.

After I got home and started my bed rest to prevent hemorrhaging, I started to panic when ever I wasn't with her, I was scared someone would drop her or who ever was watching her would fall asleep and she would be smothered. I shook these off tho. As the months went on, those fears got worse. I started to think people were going to break in to kidnap her, or someone was trying to kill her. I still didn't feel bonded, I just felt stuck. I started to plan my way out, but real plan it. I was going to have my husband watch her and I would drive up into the mountains and just, well I am sure you can assume. When she was around 6 months old, the hallucinations started. I would see a man in the room with me and my baby, I assumed it was my husband. This happened for days before I asked my husband why he wouldn't talk to me when he came in at night.

I still didn't know there was something wrong. My husband felt like he lost his wife, but we didn't think PPD, PPA and Pp psychosis could happen to me.

When my daughter turned 1 I finally felt some what bonded with her. I loved her and cared for her at this point. But I truly believed my husband would be able to raise our daughter much better without me in the picture. I told him how I felt, how I had a plan, how truly unstable I felt. So he did what needed to be done and locked all of our fire arms in the safe and changed the passwords. And wouldn't leave me alone with our daughter. Tho I never wanted to hurt her. It was around this time my hallucinations went away.

I still didn't get help.

I didn't get help until my daughter turned 3.5 years old, she is 4 now. I am on medication and am trying to find a therapist. During those years I was so torn and mentally ill. I feel like I missed out on her early life, I wasn't present. I was so scared of her dying, being hurt, messing up and traumatizing her for life, someone kidnapping her, someone hurting her and me not knowing, and wanting to end my life, I wasn't there even tho I was.

I am better now. I have anxiety and panic attacks once a month. But with medication I only have a deppresive episode once a month or every other month. It takes time, but there is hope. We missed all the symptoms because we didn't think it could happen to me. Know the symptoms, tell everyone the symptoms, so you can get help even if you don't see it.

anonymousblep,"I hate doing this. But I could really use a friend or someone I can talk to every now and then. About anything. Venting, bullshitting, meme sharing, anything. I understand the busy lifestyle as a mom, but I’m tired of always being flaked on or feeling like I’m a bad person and that’s why I don’t have any friends. Like I’m incapable of forming lasting connections. 

Of course I have my husband and I love him to death. He’s my one and only best friend. While I appreciate him and am so thankful, it’d be nice to have someone I can talk to outside of my immediate family especially while dealing with PPD. I can’t afford therapy, otherwise I would just go that route.

hazel145,"I’m (21F) 8 months postpartum and it’s been a few months of me struggling really bad before I finally got the courage to get some help. Last week I contacted a crisis line in my area and they have hooked me up with all the right people, I will be starting counselling within a few weeks. 

The problem is my boyfriend (30M) who I live with doesn’t seem to understand what I’m truly going through. I have a hard time getting out of bed some days, I have a really hard time cleaning up after everybody (he has another kid from a previous relationship) I have a hard time keeping up with laundry, I feel so extremely overwhelmed with everything. Other days I’m better so this may be confusing for him I don’t know how to explain it for him to understand. We’ve gotten into some pretty nasty fights and it’s always ending with me in tears feeling completely useless, I’ve slept on the couch more times than I can count within the last month. He says I’m lazy, I’m just making this up, I’m capable of doing more during the day, I have no reason to be overwhelmed I’m just at home with a baby all day, I don’t have anything to truly worry about. After one nasty fight we had I sent him a link on what dads can do to help their partners with postpartum depression get through it, he apologized and said he’s going to work on how he talks to me blah blah blah, the next day he’s back to what he always says to me. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore my heart is broken and I just need some links that I can send him off google if anyone has some good ones to read through. I can’t leave him right now physically and mentally it’ll be too much for me to just pack up and go.",Postpartum_Depression,In need of some links or resources,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mynzho/in_need_of_some_links_or_resources/,1619430754.0,2021-04-26 02:52:34,
Istartbutneverfini,"I had a baby a year ago and started experiencing post partum depression almost immediately. I stopped breastfeeding and I was put on Sertraline and have been on it for about 3 months. I felt fine at first - great actually! So focused but not overly concentrated. I was also taking medical marijuana for my chronic illness and felt it was helping but I’m taking a T break for the next two weeks to cut back. 

For the past month or so, I’ve been feeling myself falling down a black hole again. I can barely remember everyday words and phrases, I feel like I’m always either indifferent or down, I cry all the time and haven’t been able to sleep well for a few weeks now. My husband say that he thinks my brain is “not being stimulated enough because I’m a stay at home mom”. My husband is supportive and loving but just doesn’t understand what I’m going through so his advice sometimes makes me so annoyed 🥴

I don’t want to feel like a mess anymore.

My undiagnosed ADHD (combined with chronic illnesses I have) was so bad I lost so many jobs and gave up on my career because of it. I’m only 28. I feel like a shell of my former self and don’t recognize the person I am right now - I’m usually outgoing and happy go lucky and now I’m just irritated and sad all the time. I keep telling everyone around me that I don’t feel like myself and that I feel helpless that I’m scared but I don’t feel like they are taking it as seriously as I am. I just want to be the version of my self that my child deserves.

LetmeusethenameIwant,"*vent post with trigger warning* 

Posted some pictures on facebook of my little and me, keeping up the happy facade and all that. And an acquaintance commented “motherhood looks good on you” under one of the photos. I know it was meant well and as a compliment, but it keeps turning over in my head. 

Motherhood looks good on me? I think about offing myself every time he wakes up at night and whenever I get overwhelmed, which with everything on my plate is constantly. I’m counting down the days till we can sleep train but I’m also super guilty about that and if I’ll ruin our attachment like every person against sleep training screams at me about. 

I don’t resent my baby but I resent myself for bringing him into the world with a shit mom like I am. No matter what I do it never seems enough.

 I’m exhausted. The baby refuses to sleep without being held. He flat refuses safe sleep in general and its a fight to get him to sleep anywhere actually safe. He’s cluster feeding and I exclusively pump so even when he does sleep, I can’t. I’m in school trying to keep my head above water with this class that is imperative to my career and education that can’t be dropped and taken another time. On top of cooking meals because otherwise I don’t get to eat, and cleaning because my partner could live in a dumpster and be fine but that’s not a safe or healthy environment for anyone. Then balancing my families bullshit because as the eldest child, the responsibility falls to me. I sleep maybe 2 hours a night which I know is half the problem with how I’m feeling. 

I’m nothing of who I was. I refuse to look in the mirror cuz I hate what I see. This tiny human deserves so much more than I can offer. He deserves a better mom. But having someone take over makes me feel like a failure, why can’t I get it together and keep it all handled and be good enough. 

If I say anything to anyone in my life they push for meds or inpatient and inpatient, being as the only inpatient in this area is at my place of work, isn’t an option without it destroying my career at this building. I want to avoid meds as it can later affect my career if it were to be found out somehow (the stigma is horribly massive in this area, most of all in the providers who work with these cases daily because they are so overwhelmed with it). 

Motherhood feels like shit right now. I love him more than anything I ever have but I really can’t wait to be through this all. I just want it to be better.

vavuxi,"So I do not have PPD but I’m massively sure my best friend does. Because of that combined with PTSD caused by traumatic, abusive treatment in the hospital during pregnancy, labor, and afterwards. Her twins were born with a severe congenital immunocompromising disorder that required them to be life flighted across the world. Where she ran into several more doctors that aggravated the whole thing. A mom who was forced to endure a c-section mid-panic attack and had her firsts stolen from her (feeding, bath, hold, first skin to skin contact) going through her 6 month old twins having to do chemo and a bone marrow transplant. She already had some issues before, and then doctors did overly treat her like she was crazy and kept telling her she NEEDED meds and therapy. Now she won’t. Anyone who suggests it or ANY other type of help is the enemy and she’ll lose her mind over it. I have no doubt she loves them but also no doubt she resents them as the faces of the derailment of her life. She cusses, yells and just neglects them. Not maliciously, but to the point where one hasn’t gained virtually any weight since last Sept (2020) and they turned 2 in Jan (2021). Everyone is either not helping enough or if they do they’re saying she’s a “shitty, terrible mom.” Her husband knows there’s a problem but he’s worried she’ll leave him off he pushes it because he sees how she freaks out on everyone else. He does nothing to stop her rampages or how she talks to their children (eg “my life would be better if i never had you” at the top of her lungs while stomping around and slamming doors). I’m worried for the girls. I miss my best friend. 

What can i do? I’m scared that she’ll snap and really hurt them, and I’m not the only one that lives in that house that’s worried about that too.

The-Chonky-one,"HUGE TRIGGER WARNING - graphic blunt talk about thoughts I had post partum please do not read if you do not think you’re in the headspace for it 

I’m well out of the PPD/A (I had both) fog, babygirl is 21 months old now. I’ve briefly shared my story in some parts of the internet, but I was inspired by a YouTuber I watch (rawbeautykristi) being so candid and blunt and just feel inspired. I hope that by sharing all the horrible details, I can help another mother going through the same. 

I had my girl the summer of 2019. I had the most easy pregnancy you could ask for, gained very little weight, no health issues, glowing skin, no morning sickness. The only gripe I could even think of was some off and on heartburn. My husband and family were all so supportive, my husband researched birth/breastfeeding with me and was so educated on all of it, my family rallied around me and lifted me up. I was on cloud 9. I was also lucky enough to go into labor naturally exactly one day after my due date, as a first time mom. Get to the hospital, lucky again and I’m already 3 CM dilated and 100% effaced after just a few hours of labor. Water breaks in triage. Labor until pain gets to be too much, get an EPI - which was placed quickly and painlessly by the most kind doctor I could ask for. 

Tried to rest once I was numb, but the anxiety of giving birth soon was too much and I couldn’t. I was going on 16+ hours without sleep, but the labor high kept me going and I hardly noticed. Morning comes, and I’m fully dilated and ready to push. Push her out in less than 20 mins, she comes out screaming, pink, and healthy. A chonk of a baby, almost 9 lbs and 22 inches long. I had one tiny, tiny baby tear. No complications, no hemorrhaging, Textbook easy birth.  All the nurses kept saying I labored and birthed like a 2nd or 3rd time mom instead of a first. I felt soooo good. 

I rode that oxytocin high for about a day and half to two days. Said what a lot of us do shortly after birth “I want another one” “I could do this a million times”. Baby had some issues transferring the sticky colostrum, so I did have to pump and triple feed some feedings - but I had tons of colostrum. Once again - soooo lucky. 

We get home, and it’s at this point I start coming down - fast. I realize just how little sleep I’ve gotten in 4-5 days. Maybe two hours? If that? The anxiety slowly starts creeping in. Will I ever sleep again? How can I sleep with her cluster feeding so often? I can’t co-sleep, she’ll suffocate and die! 

Sleep when baby sleeps. Okay. I lay her down in her bassinet, she’s such an easy baby and naps for two hours for me. I lay down, close my eyes, and suddenly realize I CANT SLEEP because what if she stops breathing? It will be my fault for not watching her! Rinse and repeat for the rest of the day.

My milk finally comes in on day two home. Soooo much milk. She’s nursing like a champ. But I start feeling... sick. Sick with love. Sick from utter, chronic, debilitating sleep deprivation - I had maybe had 3 hours of scattered sleep in one week, if that. Sick with anxiety, I was convinced she would either stop breathing in her sleep or I would fall asleep nursing and suffocate her. I felt like a monster for not feeling the high I felt after birth. I was crashing. 

To be honest, I can’t remember exactly when it started to go beyond baby blues. It was quick, I know that. I started regretting having her. I loved her so much it physically hurt, but I also wished I never had her. I thought I would never sleep again. I would never feel normal again. I would never not be sick with debilitating anxiety again. 

I started to get horrible, horrible intrusive images in my head. Images of people hurting her in every way you can imagine (yes- EVERY way), imagines of ME hurting her, her dad hurting her. The most horrible one I struggled with was this - I’d picture me taking a gun, shooting her, then shooting myself in the head. This image flashed in my head atleast every 5 minutes. I tried so, so hard to fight it. Id try to picture a flower coming out of the gun. It never worked. I also kept getting horrible images of me dropping her and her skull cracking open. Over and over and over. Once again, I tried my best to reframe it. I’d picture her falling onto a soft, fluffy cloud. But my brain would intercept, the cloud wouldn’t hold, and she’d fall to the ground. 

I felt like I was fighting a demon in my head. I loved her, why was I thinking these thoughts? Were they my thoughts? I love her so much I can’t even sleep for fear of her dying, but when I close my eyes I see myself killing her? What is going on? Why did no women prepare me for this? Why, on Gods green earth, did I ever fucking think having a baby was a good idea? This is the worst decision I ever made, I will never be normal again. I’m an idiot. I’m a bad mom. I’m a bad wife. My daughter doesn’t deserve a mom like this. Look at how happy my husband is to be a dad, I’m a piece of shit for feeling this way. Maybe I should kill myself. Then atleast I won’t feel this way anymore, and if I’m dead, I can’t hurt her. She’ll be safe if I’m dead. But wait, I don’t want to die! What do I do? 

This was my inner monologue, on repeat, mixed with horrific, horror movie level intrusive thoughts of different scenarios happening to my daughter and myself. Oh yeah, and chronic sleep deprivation that would make prisoners of war shudder. 

Day 4-6 idfk home and my dad stops by. I’m in a daze. I’m hating everything about this, I’m hating myself, hating her, but loving her so damn much at the same time. It all made no fucking sense. My dad asks me if I’m okay, and the dam broke. I SOBBED. I wailed. I told him, and my husband, everything. I couldn’t hold back. I had to get it out. I couldn’t do it anymore. 

I kept saying “I don’t want them to take my baby” listen here and now women - THEY WONT TAKE YOUR BABY. You don’t have to suffer. I repeat, THEY WILL NOT TAKE YOUR BABY. We call a therapist family friend, he says I sound like I have very severe PPD and he wants me to go straight to the hospital. I would lick satans asshole to feel better at this point, so despite the fear of losing her to CPS - I go. I leave my sweet baby girl at home with her grandpa, heartbroken and missing her so much it hurts before I even get to the car, and go to the hospital. 

We get there. Get checked in. Get to the poorly ran phyc ward. They take my jewelry. They cut my beautiful custom day collar my husband had made for me (we didn’t have the key), permanently ruining it. As if I could kill myself with it. I wait 4 hours for a social worker to ask me the standard questions. Visiting time is up, and my husband has to leave. This is when it all hits me. I sob, and tell him to tell our baby girl mommy loves her so much and I’m doing this so I can be a better mommy for her. Id never seen my husband so helpless. It broke my heart into a million pieces. 

I pump while there, while nurses stare me down because apparently you can kill yourself with a breast pump. A delusional man stares in my room all night. I’m scared of him. I hide under the blanket, and a nurse comes in and scolds me and tells me I can’t hide my face. I sleep backwards (foot by headboard head by footboard) so he can’t see me. Somehow I pass out from sheer exhaustion. 

Morning comes. My dad visits while husband is home with baby. My dad looked so fucking helpless and worried sick for me, my God I love that man - I could not ask for a better dad. But seeing the worry, hurt, anxiety, and anger (over how I was being treated by the hospital) on his face just broke me again. 

I get transferred to a mental health hospital type place. They put me in the unit for fucking drug addicts. I get there, and people are fighting, high, withdrawing from drugs. I’m petrified. I’m bleeding, my breasts are swollen and leaking, I miss my baby more than anything I’ve ever missed in my entire life, and I’m surrounded by unstable (mostly male - they didn’t separate by gender there) drug addicts. My dad and husband come to see me there, while step mom/grandma watches baby. THANK GOD FOR MY VILLAGE. My dad is ENRAGED to see me in this unit. They said the depression unit had no beds. My dad pulls a nurse to the side, and somehow, I have no idea - he gets me transferred. Once again, I love my dad sooo fucking much. He is my hero. 

I get to the depression unit. It’s slightly better. I find out despite being promised a short 3 day stay so I can get medicated and stabilized and quickly return to my baby who needs me, I’m going to be forced to stay 6 fucking days because I came before a weekend. I felt the world crashing down around me. I could not be away from my baby that long. I broke. I managed to get a private chat with the head therapist, and begged him to let me go home. I had support, I promised to go straight to therapy, take my meds, sleep, take the help from family and my husband. His hands were tied, I guess. So I stay. I feel like a prisoner. I will never, ever judge someone who’s served time again. What I felt there, not being unable to leave, was the most dehumanizing feeling I can imagine. I don’t have words for it. I can’t imagine doing that for months or years. 

I manage to get some good ass sleep there, and I think that’s what helped me the most. The sleep deprivation really amplified everything I was feeling. The meds helped as well. We do bullshit group therapy, I’m surrounded by young adults with severe mental health issues who can’t relate to my post partum issues as an old mom at all so it really didn’t do much for me. I get like two “sessions” with the psychologist which is just asking the most basic questions you can ask.

What also helped me a lot, was pumping. It made me feel like I was atleast doing something for her while I was there. My husband picked the milk up everyday after visiting me. God bless him. A new dad, dealing with a newborn, and a sick wife who was being forced to stay somewhere away from her newborn. It was so traumatic for him, too. While I pumped, nurses had to sit with me. I did love the nurses. Every one of them, every fucking single one, told me they had the exact same thoughts after their baby. One nurse said “i remember about a week after I had my daughter, I was so so tired and sitting there rocking my sweet little baby, and I looked down at her precious face and thought ‘now I understand why some moms throw their babies out of windows’ “ I felt so validated and heard by these women during our pumping conversations. Another nurse who was from the Middle East told me how hard she struggled, and how she couldn’t talk about it in her home country because no one believes PPD is real there. She said she felt she never really recovered from the trauma of it because she had to fight tooth and nail through it with no help at all. But, while I felt validated and heard, I also felt very, very angry. If this is so common, why did no one prepare me? Why did my OBGYN not mention it? Why did my stepmom, aunt, mother, coworkers, cousin or anyone else tell me to watch out for it? Or that it was normal, treatable, and common? WHY? Why did no one, especially other mothers, ask me how I was feeling mentally after birth? Not a single mother asked me. It took my dad asking me for me to get help. 

Towards the end of my stay, I get the most amazing surprise I can ever ask for. A visit with my beautiful baby girl. I tear up now thinking about it. It was short, and she slept the whole time on my chest, and they didn’t allow me to nurse her, but it gave me the strength I needed to keep going. 

The 6th day comes and I get to leave. The second I walk out those doors, hand in hand with my amazing, blessing of a husband, I know I can do it. Would I feel good every day? No. Would I still get anxiety and depression, and intrusive to thoughts? Yes. But I will make it though. And I did.

deadhoe9,"So my PPA/PPD has been getting a lot better with a combo of meds and therapy and I've been doing a great job controlling my emotions and triggers. But today I am PISSED. So, my husband has 2 brothers and 1 sister. Today my husband was talking to his sister, we'll call her ""Karah"", and told him about something fucked up his brother's wife, we'll call her ""Ella"", said about our baby/us as parents. If it's unclear, Ella is the asshole SIL.



For context, Ella is just an asshole in general. She physically assaulted my husband's brother because he was listening to rap music and according to her it's racist for white people to listen to rap (she's white btw). Like she straight up slapped him in the face and started wailing on him unprovoked just because she heard him pull up in his car listening to rap. She also once got black put drunk and took a shit in her husband's crock pot to ""get back at him"" for talking to another girl at a family gathering. Who was that girl? HIS FUCKING COUSIN. So clearly she's not a very nice person.



Well, apparently a few minutes after we announced over group text to our families that our baby had arrived and we were all safe and healthy, she calls up Karah and straight up tells her that my husband and I being parents is going to end badly for us and our baby and that she didn't think we were fit to be parents. She never said why or elaborated, just dropped that bomb on what was the happiest moment of my husband and I's life literally MINUTES after our baby was born. Who tf does that??? Karah is awesome and went off on her and shut that shit down immediately, telling her it wasn't cool what she said and that she's lucky she's even allowed in the family at all after the shit she pulled. Imo Ella lucky we live on the other side of the country and that I didn't find out that she said that until I was 3 months PP and doing better mentally or else she would get an earful and then some.

Catzy94,"I’ve posted in here a few times about having postpartum and dealing with CPS due to using marijuana to cope with it. I was starting to feel a little better and even got an appointment booked for this Monday with a psychiatrist.

Yesterday I had to put my dog down. He was only seven and I was not ready. I know I gave him a good life. He was spoiled rotten and traveled everywhere with me. If you’ve ever seen the Pixar short called Winston, not only did Bebop look like that, but he ate like that. Everyone loved him because he couldn’t abide people being sad. I’m pretty sure he was convinced dog slobber applied directly to the face via tongue could cure anything.

Putting him down was hard but I stayed with him. Fortunately my area has low COVID numbers so my partner and our son came in with me. The last picture I have of Bebop is my son petting him. It was weird to have the vet techs cooing over my son while trying to be sympathetic about my dog.

Now it’s raining cats, dogs and small children and there’s a tornado watch issued for my county. We moved here last August so this is our first storm season here. I’ve lived in South Texas most of my life so I’m used to hurricanes, not tornadoes.

With a hurricane, you get weeks of warning and I know how to prepare for them. I keep a binder with all our important documents and a checklist for evacuations. The second the national weather service projects over a Cat 2, I board up and get the hell out. The hurricanes I’ve been through have caused tornadoes, but I’ve never seen one because I always evacuate. I only see the damage when I come back.

Being in East Texas now, we’re too far from the Gulf for hurricanes. That was one of the reasons I wanted to move here. But I know nothing about tornadoes. The extent of my knowledge comes from the movie Twister.

We’re safe but seriously what did I do to piss off the universe? Which planet is acting up and causing this mess? Is Mercury in Gatorade again?

My wife says she depressed and we just had our baby boy about  a month ago. This is the 3rd time she has turned into a nuke (rage mode) and is very emotional and explosive in a very negative way. I'm not sure how to even talk to her with out getting my head ripped off.  I'm always here for her and I want to help. Any tips would be great, I just want her back to her happy silly self. What sets her off is that she can only produce about 30% of milk for our son and she sees herself as a failure.

dykgdwryjkogrsseh,"This is my second time posting here. Last time I got the most amazing support i have ever received in my life so i thought i would try to reach out again.

I read online that writing a letter to your loved ones would help deal with any unwanted thoughts and make you realize how much you have to be grateful for.  Mine turned into a good bye letter to my husband and 11 months son. I cried all morning but it did not make me want to stick around any more - it had the opposite effect.

I'm so tired of my circumstances and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

My husband's family is awful and for reasons i don't want to get into we live with his parents. My mother in law has wanted this since we started dating. They are very paranoid people and do not want anyone to know anything about them. This is why I haven't shared anything with anyone about my situation. They also speak a second language in the house that i don't understand. 

My mother-in-law picks at me every day all day. I'm not walking my son enough, I'm walking him to much. Why did you not feed him?! He's not hungry why are you giving him food?! The way she askes questions set me up to fail. Are you giving him egg? Me , sure he can have egg. Don't you know he had it already?! (I work full Time and dont know what she feeds him unless she tells me)then she goes to my husband and tells him how bad mother i am. 

She has been doing this behind my back for a while. When she does not get her Way she slams doors and ignored me. 

Last time she ignored me for three days because my baby woke up at 5 am and cried. She got up and told my husband in their language that i was a bad mother, i was tramatizing my baby and grabbed him and took him to her bedroom. I tried to get him back but she would not give him to me until someone else interwened. They yelled and hit things i thought the police would get called.

I told my husband that we need to leave but he keeps dragging it out. He wants to wait for the end of summer so we can all call it of with dignity and to get our afairs in order.

I don't think I can make it that long.

Catzy94,"I posted recently about my old therapist reporting me to CPS for medicating my postpartum with marijuana. The report was made last Friday, it’s now Wednesday. I had an appointment already scheduled before she called me about the report and decided to go through with it.

I needed her to see what her report did to me. The pre-screening before my last appointment showed me stabilizing. I had a high score for risk assessment this week. I openly told her that I have plans for suicide that I will follow through on if CPS removes my son. I told her flat out that if her report causes me to lose custody, my blood will be squarely in her hands.

Despite that, it went surprisingly well. She kept trying to reassure me that her report stated that she didn’t think I should lose custody and that I am a fit mother, I’m just struggling with postpartum. It’s very weird to have the very person who shattered your world try to convince you that everything’s going to be okay.

She told me she wrestled with herself for a long time before making the report. I pointed out that she says she thinks I’m a fit mother, so what was the point of the report? What did she expect to come out of it? She could never really answer that.

I’ve seen this doctor for years. She’s seen me survive homelessness, abuse, rape, and multiple suicide attempts. I have never been this bad off and I know she could see it. She tried to tell me she didn’t intend to harm me. I pointed out that her intentions didn’t matter. Regardless of her intentions, her actions threatened my custody, and therefore my life.

It felt good to know that she sees the harm she did. She tried to say that she’s on my side and would even contact CPS for an update so I can stop being anxious. That she would tell them again she didn’t think I should lose custody. And she tried to get me an emergency appointment with my old psychiatrist for medication. I finally relented just before the end of our conversation but I haven’t signed the forms allowing her to contact them. I pointed out that trying to get me an emergency appointment came with the risk of involuntary commitment. How can I trust anyone to help me after her report?

I’m so exhausted but I’m cuddled up with my son right now. He’s been fussy all day and I think it’s because he’s somewhat aware of how much I’m suffering. I was laying in my bed a few feet away and he reached for him. That’s the first time he’s done that. I melted. Now he’s fussing for me to pay attention to him instead of my phone so I’ll stop rambling.

Luunaer,"I've suffered with depression for about 10 years of my life. And never chosen to be medicated just because I've been a counsellor and I don't feel like it would help me. I also don't want to take a drug which gives me false emotions and I also feel like I enjoy punishing myself to some degree so I can control something.

I feel like these days we live in such a thankless world. Where people don't appreciate others and people seem to be very selfish. I think tbh the Internet hasn't helped. I also feel like no one really truly listens. And I've always been a great listener, great at giving advice... Labeled as ""the strong one"". And to be honest I'm totally drowning.

I don't want to go to the NHS for help because I've been a counsellor before and if I get stuck with someone feeding the same lines to every person it'd just make things worse. So I'm hoping coming here, even if it's just to hear I'm not the only one and I can vent to someone then maybe I can get through my days. Sorry this will be a long post.

I have 3 children. (15, almost 4 and 2). I've run a business since I was 18 and now I'm 32. I've worked part time in the evenings when my kids go to bed for the last 4 years since my middle son was born. And tbh I have never really been a maternal person in the sense of my children are my identity and all I want in life is children. My depression got much worse when my youngest was born. I had a horrific birth and we both almost died. And not that I went into a deep depression because of me, I went into a worse depression because I was thinking what if my son had died. I spent about 6 months when he was 3 months old going out every weekend and getting drunk and I just didn't want to be home. I didn't want to face reality. Of course, when I was at home I put a smile on my face and pretended I was fine but it almost broke off my 11 year relationship because I was too selfish. I needed time for myself, to be me not just a mum. Which is the most thankless and under appreciated job in the world. Being a woman is hard enough, being a mother, a partner, a caretaker, a cleaner, a chef, everyone's rock and their support system is taxing and I literally have nothing for myself. No identity. No life other than my kids.

After my 6m of going out I was really happy and then covid hit and I had to close my business in January. Not that that's a negative I'm now retraining into programming and I'm looking on the bright side because my middle child goes to school in September full time. However every day I'm forcing myself to wake up, to be a parent and give them everything they need but I'm not looking after myself. I've gained weight, I often can't even be bothered to brush my hair, I don't wear makeup and I'm just sad ALL the time. I'm sat here balling my eyes out because I literally can't do it anymore. I keep telling myself it's only 4 months but it feels like I'm not going to make it. I want to get a new job so badly so I can work full time just to get away from the kids. So that I can be me again and for the days I spend with them I want to give my all. But at the moment I just can't do that. I can't even be bothered to clean.

I've told myself I've just got to get up and be positive but I've reached the point where I can't do that. And I just need someone to talk to. Someone who doesn't pretend their life is perfect, someone I can be real with and someone who can be real with me.

My partner is amazing, he's supportive etc but I just don't think he gets it. He isn't a woman, women are wired differently and we're wired to just get on with it and multitask. I'm not trying to be sexist we just have better attention to detail. And I want my kids to be happy and I want them to thrive but I just can't do it. How do I fix myself? How do I make things better? I just can't see a light at the end of the tunnel. And I can't be positive.

BoomBunnie,"I've been doing pretty well lately. I've been working extremely hard on myself - making sure I use self-care, going easy on myself, seeing a therapist once a week, journaling, drawing, playing video games...all that on top of being a mom has been pretty exhausting, but its working. My relationships are getting better, I'm starting to feel connected to people again. I even finally had an orgasm which has been EXTREMELY long since I've been able to...but tonight when watching the new episode of this show, it sent me into a weird spiral. When I reached out to try to talk things through with someone, it didn't really work. I'm getting the feeling they're tired of hearing about it. Which made me feel pretty miserable. I know that's probably my self-doubt and PPD talking - but it sucks nonetheless. I'd like to go back to where I was earlier today. I felt like I was kicking ass. All this week really! I don't want to spiral, and I'm trying extremely hard right now not to lose it. 

In the episode, the character with PPD talked about how it was logical for her to feel like a good mother, but she just didn't feel it. That hit me pretty hard as something I feel. The thing she said that I resonated most with was how hard she worked to overcome so many things, but this one thing that she can't deal with alone. That very thing kills me. I've fought so hard to overcome so much, is PPD what's going to take me out? It feels like it sometimes. Before lately, it felt like it was definitely going to do me in...every day. 

It brought me back to how I was fantasizing about dying and a new better mother/wife came to take my place and how much better my family would be doing with her. Of course, I imagine her beautiful, smart, charming, and outstanding mother...perfect really. Which doesn't exist. It just hurt, and it made me feel so lonely, and like such a huge burden. 

I live with severe gastroparesis. Pain every day. And other health issues. I've survived a surgery gone terribly wrong that resulted in life-changing hardships.

I had a c section, and when people ask me about the birth, I feel like I'm over explaining why it was necessary (as if I had any control over it). 

My husband takes over with the baby in the morning so that I can get some extra rest and when I finally get up makes a joke (""good morning sleeping beauty, how do you feel?"") and I snap on him.

I feel like I'm constantly over-justifying my parenting choices or snapping on people (primary my poor husband). But I can't stop. Logically, I know that these are all innocent remarks, I just feel like someone is constantly judging my every move. I haven't even brought up this part of how I'm feeling in therapy yet. Why?

I have two children with a pretty decent age gap. My youngest is 10 months and I honestly feel like the depression started the moment I found out I was pregnant. 
I'm tired of feeling hollow. I had the intrusive thoughts and suicidal ideations shortly after my 6 wk PP appointment. Experienced a traumatic birth and would play it over and over in my head. I had mild PPD with my first and told my partner to help me recognize if I started slipping to make me get help.

I finally broke down a few months ago and started therapy. After my ""trial"" period ran out I didn't continue. It was kind of helpful but it required a lot of work on my part and as much as I wanted it I just didn't have the energy to commit. Big mistake.

We were talking like we used to and it made me so happy until they started getting all nostalgic and bring up things from middle school and early high school (I got pregnant at 17). I was smiling and laughing but I was dying inside. I don't think that they realize how much I miss doing things with them and with the pandemic and the baby I don't feel like I can anymore. 

After the call, I literally put my baby to bed and curled up in the corner, and cried myself to sleep. My fiancé found me there when she got home and I still haven't told her what happened. 

I miss just getting to be a kid. I miss being able to just randomly do things with my friends with no care in the world. I miss being able to talk about my emotions and not have anybody judge me for it. I can't count on both hands the number of times I've been shamed for feeling depressed. 

It's not that I don't love my baby, I do. I just feel like she'd be better off with a mother who doesn't feel terrible about every little thing. I tried joining another support group on Reddit but I had a horrible experience that made me feel even worse. Someone told me that I should just put my baby up for adoption and call it a day. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I have a therapist and she's wonderful and helps a lot but I feel like that only helps for a couple of days and then I'm stuck trying to get through the rest of the week. I tried meds but my doctor refused to put me on anything but Zoloft which at 50mg made things worse and then at 100mg made me sick and made things much worse. They're the only doctor in the area who has availabilities and takes my insurance so I'm stuck. 

Journaling and making posts to get things off my chest helps momentarily but then I feel terrible about making other people read about how shitty I feel and I delete the post.

I feel so alone and helpless. And it's not like I can reach out to anyone for immediate help because I don't have a phone and I can't find anything online that's free (I have literally no money). I feel so empty. The only emotions I feel anymore are anger, depression, and emptiness.

I feel like I have to fake everything at this point. I fake a smile. I fake a laugh. I fake being okay. I fake being happy. I feel terrible all. the. time.

Catzy94,"I had a therapist when I was an undergrad. Since I’m enrolled again, I set up appointments with her again. I’ve always had the policy of being honest with doctors. I smoke weed because it’s been the only thing that helps. I also breastfeed but I try to wait as long as possible between smoking and nursing. 24 hours minimum. Doctor reported me to CPS.

I live for my son. I read to him constantly. I’ve planned so much for his future. By every metric he’s not just healthy, he’s ahead of every milestone. The pediatrician is always impressed with how fast he’s growing and learning. His favorite thing is me reading to him.

I smoke to stay sane, to keep me from digging out the razor blades and hurting myself. I smoke so my son doesn’t have to see how miserable I am. It’s not his fault the chemicals in my brain refuse to work correctly.

I honestly don’t think me smoking is hurting him. He doesn’t show a single sign that it’s affected him. But maybe I’m wrong and I am a terrible mom for it. I just want to do what’s best for me. And apparently my doctor thinks what’s best for him is to not have me in his life. Maybe she’s right. And maybe I’m selfish for not wanting to live in a world where I’m not his mom anymore.

Rationally, I know that CPS probably doesn’t care and won’t do anything. I tested positive during my pregnancy when I was homeless and suicidal. The case worker told me multiple times they don’t care about weed. He told me he was angry because we’re good parents and investigating us is a waste of his time.

SonnyDoodie,"Yesterday was such a glorious day. I had someone watch my baby while I got a massage and facial and then my in laws came over at night time to take care of her and put her to bed while my husband and I napped. When they left my husband told me to stay in bed until her middle of the night feeding. So I got pampered for 1.5 hours and I got the opportunity to sleep from about 6 pm until 2 am. But I didn’t sleep, I couldn’t sleep, I worried about her and I scrolled through my phone. I slept probably 3 hours. This morning I woke up and asked my mom if she could come help me because I felt like I couldn’t get out of bed I was so sad. She wasn’t available to come over so I sucked it up and got up. Spent the day crying but I did what I had to do. It was today that I broke down and scheduled myself some therapy. I should have had a great day feeling super rested even if baby was being difficult today. But I can’t sleep even when I’m given the time to. I can’t enjoy anything constantly worrying. And I have to stop the tears somehow. I’ve been on Zoloft since before pregnancy and they increased my dose after I gave birth 2 months ago, but I still need something more. I feel like a terrible parent not enjoying her being in our lives and simply going through the motions because I have to not because I want to. I miss my old life and my husband.

How do you tell someone you feel like you want to die? You feel like you want to self harm? But you don’t want them to worry? You don’t want them for feel burdened or responsible? You just want someone to know? I guess it’s just that old feeling of I don’t want to say anything because I don’t want to look like I’m seeking attention, but inside I’m screaming. And because I don’t know why I feel this way, because I don’t know what I need to hear or say, or do. I don’t really understand my own need to say it, especially when it seems to come with so many consequences.

I did try to talk to someone, and they seemed to understand a little but I didn’t want to push my luck and say no it’s more than that.

I lost my baby July 2020...I miscarried silent &amp; alone in the bathroom in the middle of the night with my ex husband sleeping on the couch. Silent because he said we shouldn't tell the other kids and our middle son was home at the time. My ex knew  but couldn't be bothered to stay with me. The next morning on the way to hospital for the D&amp;C he yelled at me for not communicating well and listening when he asked if I could drive myself.

 I was told a few weeks latter that I had scored very high on post partum depression test. I started and therapy off and on but was focused on trying to keep going. I didnt take time off after I found out the baby had no heart beat or after the surgery since I started a high stress new job.  The ex person ended up taking another woman on vacation 5 days after I miscarried while I was struggling to pay bills. 


In the end, after the physical abuse, the emotional abuse the miscarriage and financial abuse I didnt break ties till December. I had believed pretty much everything he's said , the last of which that I couldn't do anything without him, I belonged to him and that I'm unstable but I'm finally getting help and trying to grieve my baby. 

What I'm concerned about now is that my period has been missing since December. I didnt notice till mid February due to moving and getting a restraining order.

smarti4891,"Apologies, if this is not the correct forum to be asking this. One of my best friends is really struggling and is starting medication, has been going to therapy and opening up to me about her challenges. All things I fully support and I let her know that. I understand what depression can feel like, but I also understand that this is different (I have never had children, so I can’t fully relate but understand and empathize with her feelings). 

What are some ways I can support her that doesn’t come off as being too pushy? I try to check in with her via text, but not sure if asking how she is feeling/doing is ok to ask all the time, or if I share something that I’ve done would make her feel worse because she has been comparing herself to others a lot lately. I try to coordinate to see her in person and I am patient and understanding when she postpones or cancels last minute due to lack of sleep and depression. I tell her the visit doesn’t have to be perfect, and even if it’s just for a few minutes between feedings, I just want to check in on her and be supportive and see her and the baby. 

Her husband has been supportive and I know she struggles on week days when he is at work, so I have made an effort to see her during the week as I have some weekdays off. Is going over with food and helping out around the house too presumptuous? I feel like if I asked to do these things she would decline my offer, but I’m not sure about that. Don’t want her to feel shame or pity. Not my intention. I really just want to help. 

She has been open about how the depression is affecting her motivation to get out of the house and her sleep. But she has never mentioned any negative feelings towards the baby. So I’m assuming things are ok in that department. Or is there a chance and she just hasn’t expressed it?

Catzy94,"My kiddo is 3.5 months. I knew at 13 I wanted to be a mother. That desire to build a family caused me to jump in and out of abusive relationships. Thankfully, at (what I thought at the time was) rock bottom, I met my future wife (FW) We were both suffering through severe mental illness and became a support for each other. That led to our relationship and it’s been mostly good.

Unfortunately, the universe hates us. First, she had to go off hormones. After several years of HRT, that was a mess. She had horrible depression and dysphoria. I started going off the rails crazy. I would hallucinate and my normally well-controlled bipolar suddenly wasn’t. If you’ve ever played Medievil, picture the stained grass demon (first boss) but red and black instead of rainbow. That would randomly be staring back at me. We tried and tried.

(FW) changed her name and gender marker during this. All of a sudden our HOA was all over us with infractions. Yes, we were breaking the rules with a vehicle we owned. But they didn’t care until after she did the name and gender marker change.

We were low on funds, trying for a kid, and now being threatened with fines that could become a lien. Eventually we managed to sell the condo at a loss and buy our current place. Except the titles couldn’t be transferred that fast, so I was homeless for a week, during the pandemic, with everything we owned in a UHaul and no idea if we would be able to move in before losing everything.

The title office was sympathetic and we moved in. We couldn’t afford movers so at 6 months pregnant, I pulled muscles I didn’t know I had moving in. Which led to a UTI that caused a fever so bad I shivered like I was seizing and couldn’t get warm. EMTs came out. I was terrified that I was going to miscarry.

Then my ex wife popped back into my life and I got laid off. Had my son, but lost my unemployment because “I couldn’t work” while giving birth. Just one thing on top of another. And I’m in grad school.

Ppd hit hard after he was born. I wound up getting shitfaced four days after getting home with him. Oh, and CPS was called on me because I had weed in my system during the whole homeless thing because I was suicidal. The CPS guy was all kinds of cool but still not something I deserved to deal with.

Flash forward to now. I love my son. I love my partner. I have a new WFH gig and am interviewing for my dream job and getting my MA in May. Everything should be peachy now, right?

Im scared to seek help because I don’t want to be hospitalized and not see my son. My psychiatrist and my therapist will be out until June and May, respectively. The wait lists for an appointment are crazy long. I’m pretty good at managing myself but I’m so depressed I can’t function.

Having my son was like getting to the finish line of the hardest obstacle course I’ve ever run. And now I’ve made it, but I made it with, like, 1HP left. I have no mana to enjoy the happy ending. I need a real life Full Restore.

And every day I feel more and more like I’m a failure. Kiddo is taken care of, but I’m not present like I should be. And I’m not working as hard as I should be. I’m m scared I’ll lose my job because I suck at it right now.  I’m scared I’ll flunk out of my last semester. I’ve always been the person who couldn’t break because people needed me.

Around 3rd week one day our kid didn’t want to drink milk more than 10 minutes . She just had pooped and cried her lungs out . We do have tricks to wake her up and that day she wAsnt ready to get up after 10 minutes . So I suggested I don’t want to agitate her and let her sleep . That kind of ticked off my wife . She was like why do you act like you know it all . Just because you don’t want to tickle her legs and wake her doesn’t mean she isn’t hungry . That kind of carried on to the next feeding session where she was like you know how much to feed her  so tell me when to stop and I will stop . Prior to this she had been talking about feeling depressed in the evenings and I assured her that she’s doing good.

Extra_sour_cream,"Our boy is 15 months now... super easy pregnancy, and i continued my athletic hobbies throughout. Quit my job for 7 months to care for him, and just...hated it! Always screaming/crying. Horrible napper. Only way to stop the crying or get him to sleep was to bounce on a yoga ball ALL DAY (and night!) (Even now i sometimes have to use it to calm him...)! He seemed miserable, and so was i. 
Fast forward, I've resumed working full time (from home due to covid), he's in daycare (it's very relieving) and i still engage frequently in my athletic hobbies. We have fun sports cars, a house with a garden I'm passionate about, my beloved rabbits (so soothing to pet) and no unusual debts.
But...he's still very whiny, easily melts down, and makes me frustrated as soon as his mood switches. I'm frustrated at this point, and grab him too sharply... Am visibly upset. And fight with my husband SO MUCH.

deadhoe9,"I recently started an SSRI and it is making me so sick. The one I'm on now, escitalopram, is slightly better side effects wise than the zoloft I tried a few weeks ago. I'm nauseous and have an upset stomach, irritable, anxious, manic, can't sleep, have no appetite, gassy, and having horrible diarrhea which is compounded by my IBS. I have my daughter's two month check up tomorrow and I don't think I'll even be able to go with my husband to the appointment because I'm having to go to the bathroom every 15-20 minutes. I know moms are supposed to put everything aside for their babies, but I really don't want to shit myself on the way to the doctor's office or while I'm there. My parents are making me feel so guilty for either facetiming my husband during her appointment or for rescheduling it for when I'm not sick. They told me to just bring a spare change of pants and underwear or wear a diaper but shitting my pants and/or wearing a diaper like my fucking baby when I'm this emotionally vulnerable sounds beyond humiliating. I really should be able to tough it out for my baby though. Why can't I? Women have been doing this for centuries, why can't I?



I'm already hardly producing 4 oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period despite pumping or trying and failing to feed every 2-3 hours day and night. I'm exhausted. And now being this sick is lowering my already limited milk supply even more which is further stressing me out. I can hardly keep water down. I'm only continuing to pump so I can give my baby antibodies from my recent covid vaccine (first shot was 2 weeks ago, these definitely aren't side effects from the vaccine) or I'd just give up. Tonight I prepared an amazing dinner for my family and couldn't eat any of it because I felt so sick. Instead I hid in the bathroom and forced down a can of cold soup eaten directly from the can because I was so hungry that I was shaking which I promptly threw up thanks to the meds. My psychiatrist said to just tough it out because being sick at the start is normal and apparently feeling better in the long run is worth it. I literally can't be a parent right now. But I also could only parent slightly better without the meds because of my PPD/PPA so the meds are most likely worth the side effects I guess. I'm either in bed or on the toilet currently. All my baby wants to do is be held and walk around or else she screams and I feel too sick to do that. My husband is having to do everything, baby care, cleaning, and taking care of me, but I was so depressed he's not doing too much more than he already did. Maybe a few more chores and a few less breaks with the baby. I can hardly get out of bed or off the toilet enough to pump or fail at feeding her from my breast. Fuck covid, I wouldn't have to do this continuing to pump thing when I have no supply if people took it seriously at the start and if my husband and I hadn't started trying right before covid hit. I feel so stupid. Idk what to do, any tips to cope with SSRI side effects when you first start taking them would be much appreciated.",Postpartum_Depression,How do you cope with medication side effects while being a parent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mh16kz/how_do_you_cope_with_medication_side_effects/,1617203089.0,2021-03-31 08:04:49,
justcurlythrora,"I’m newly single mom. I’ve felt like a single mom since my son was born 8 months ago but it’s basically new. I got pregnant quickly and unexpectedly with my ex. My ex was supportive all pregnancy but after my son was born it’s like a switch flipped. It was like he started resenting me. He went out a lot. Lied where he was and who he was with. Constantly broke even while working more than full time and asking me for money. We argued daily. I’m not gonna lie I had PPD and was trying to recover but this was not helping at all.

Thrway4AFriend352,"To start off I'm a man with very little experience in these areas. I'm attempting to make sense of the position my friend is in and what I can do to help. My friend, let's call him Adam, is married to Brie, and they currently have a 14 month old and Brie is also \~6 months pregnant. Adam works 70+ hours a week and Brie is a SAHM. For the last couple of years Brie would have these emotional outbursts, ripping into Adam for days at a time, demeaning him and then turning it around if he attempts to defend himself, saying things like how worthless she is and that Adam should just leave. 

Before her first pregnancy these episodes were few and far between, and she was always extremely apologetic after the fact. Starting with her first pregnancy things started becoming more intense and more frequent, which Adam attributed to pregnancy hormones. After the first child was born Brie's episodes again started getting more intense, which Adam attributed to PPD/PPA. Brie became pregnant and things stepped up another notch, this time with Adam attributing it the combination of PPD/PPA on top of pregnancy hormones.

While Adam works a lot, he's never been much of a sleeper, and frequently makes time to help Brie out with the baby. Brie's sister moved in a few months ago to help with the baby and other household chores (basically a part time nanny/housekeeper). Their baby seems low maintenance (for a baby, not in general) and surprisingly well behaved, sleeps through the night, doesn't have many crying fits. Even so, Brie's behavior continues to intensify. She'll often sleep all day, offload chores, and show disinterest in watching their baby. She'll constantly interrupt Adam while he's working and in meeting (WFH), becoming aggressive about things he did or didn't do. She belittles him and attacks his shortcomings or anything that might make him insecure - e.g., she'll mock him for his sexual performance (he's on antidepressants) and then suddenly switch to how ugly she must be. She also started digging through his messages to me and holding that against him. There have been a couple instances of her throwing expensive electronics across the room, breaking them, and even injured Adam's back when she slammed him against the wall to prevent him from leaving. Brie has told Adam he is not allowed to talk about anything that happens in the house to their friends and family (such as even that his back is injured). She'll leave the house with their baby and drive for hours while nonstop texting Adam about what a terrible person he is and that she's going to leave (I find this to be extremely reckless and dangerous).

Adam is at a loss as to what to do and is under the impression that he just needs to wait out the pregnancy hormones and PPD/PPA. However, Brie flat out refuses therapy, both at an individual level as well as couple's therapy. She also refuses to take medication (assuming it would be prescribed). I used to really like Brie but a lot of this behavior is upsetting. I don't feel like this behavior is simply going to resolve itself but this is all new territory for me and I'm concerned that this is likely just flat out abusive behavior. Any thoughts, guidance, resources would be greatly appreciated.",Postpartum_Depression,Trying to understand PPD/PPA vs an abusive relationship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mgrs6a/trying_to_understand_ppdppa_vs_an_abusive/,1617168722.0,2021-03-30 22:32:02,

MochaMaker,"I'm seeing a doctor on Tuesday, that was the soonest they could see me, till then I hold on the best I can.

I delivered my baby on 2/1/21, she arrived 30+3 because I'd developed Preeclampsia-HELLP. When I got the magnesium drip, I got scared when I heard talk of strokes and seizures. At one point I told my husband that if something happened to me, I wouldn't blame him if he got remarried.. 
Baby was delivered vaginally and was whisked off the NICU immediately before I could even see her. I was in the hospital for a week because my blood pressure was regularly high and I felt overall sick including heart palpitations.

 My first night in the postpartum ward, I sat in my room alone  (my husband had to go home to check on our teen son) , I broke down and cried, when the nurse came to check on me, I sobbed and told her I was afraid that if I fell asleep I wouldn't wake up. The nurse left briefly and returned to gave me a benadryl, check my blood pressure and left me alone again. My husband had brought me a stuffed animal earlier which I clung to and sobbed on till the benadryl knocked me out. I went to sleep thinking my teen son wouldn't miss me if something happened to me.

On 2/5/21, I was able to go home, I cried on my husband's shoulder that I felt like a failure,  that'd I'd let our baby down,  he hugged me and assured me it wasn't my fault but here I am still feeling heavy with guilt. 
At 4 almost 5 weeks postpartum,  I felt extremely sick and knew something was off, my blood pressure was through the roof despite the medication I was taking. I went to the ER and was readmitted for postpartum preeclampsia, I was at the hospital for 3 days with another round of magnesium and then sent home again.
At my 6 week postpartum check up I told my doctor I'm still not feeling right. Since my baby was born I've been dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous, short of breath, and fatigued, overall I feel off. I cry everyday, I burst into tears and sob into my pillow at night. I cry when I get to my car after leaving the NICU. Tears stream down my face while I hold my baby and none of the NICU nurses are around. My doctor wasn't keen on prescribing medication and suggested vitamins such as vitamin D3, some probiotics,etc. 
I still feel ill daily regardless. 

2 days ago (8weeks postpartum)I went to the NICU to see my baby, not even 20 minutes there, my heart began racing despite the fact I was simply sitting quietly reading, I waited, but even after 15 minutes my heart rate went even faster, it felt like it was pounding against my chest, I got scared and sought help. One of the NICU nurses wheeled me downstairs to the ER department, but after 3 hours and a round of tests, they said nothing was wrong and sent me home.

Today, my husband and I went to the NICU together to see our baby. At one point the dizziness set in again, I was sitting back in the reclining chair provided while I held our baby close, we had just fed her and we had to keep her elevated as she has reflux. I tilted her slightly as I was caught off guard by the dizziness and she spit up a bit. My husband immediately scolded me for tilting her back causing the spit up. I began to cry, he then began to tell me there's no reason to cry, he asked me what was wrong which made me cry even more. We'd originally planned that I'd take maternity leave when baby came home and when my leave was done he'd take paternity leave but after this incident he said ""I think I should go on leave first if you're going to be like this"". 

I feel crushed, It's been nearly 2 months. I just want to feel better, I want to hold my baby. I'm so tired of driving to the hospital NICU everyday. I'm afraid to even go to the store alone because of the dizziness and palpitations. I keep telling my  doctors (GP, OBGYN, cardiologist)somethings wrong but even after countless blood tests and  appointments, they can't seem to find an answer. I cry because I'm scared, I fear I won't get to watch my daughter grow up.
Every time my husband asks me what's wrong I just cry,  I can't get the words out to describe what's wrong with me. I feel like a burden to him as he's left work early or called out countless times to help me. We can't afford it really.

 I just feel so broken and worthless right now. I'm praying the doctors can find an answer.",Postpartum_Depression,Struggling and scared vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mfjb7e/struggling_and_scared_vent/,1617024562.0,2021-03-29 06:29:22,
djshaver21,"I spoke with my doctor of osteopath about my PPD/PPA. During his residency he noticed many women who had magnesium drips showed greater signs of PPD. 

I was diagnosed with PPD/PPA about a month before I gave birth. I then has severe preeclampsia, induced labor at 34 weeks, “labored/ pushed” for about 8-10 hours, CT scan to make sure I didn’t have a brain bleed, then ended up with an emergency c-section. We had to stay in the hospital for a week due to my blood pressure not stabilizing and daughter was in the NICU for 5 days. We had to stay in our room, due to Covid, they didn’t want us walking around. my husband couldn’t leave or else he wouldn’t be allowed back in for 24 hrs. And I couldn’t really walk due to all the swelling and blood pressure problems. I was pretty messed up physically for awhile, i still get numb hands, carpal tunnel the obgyn said would go away after giving birth, it’s been 9months and it still comes and goes. Much better than before tho. it was all pretty traumatic for me.  Sorry for the rant birth story. But I also think the birthing experience increases our PPD/PPA. No one EVER talked to me about how traumatic giving birth really is. All the women in my life looked great when they came home and had everything together it seemed. Tired yes but never traumatized.

Our baby is easy compared to other babies I hear about he’s been sleeping in his own room and through the night since month 3 so it’s been over two months of us getting good sleep and on top of that he’s not really a crazy fussy baby or hard to feed honestly I feel like we hit the baby lottery he’s such an easy baby to care for. I’m the only one who works my wife wanted to be a stay at home mom and thankfully I make enough for us to afford this and not have money issues. We don’t fight about money. Honestly idk why we fight or argue or why we are at this point but I’m so lost, I’ve said we should go to marriage counseling or therapy and that maybe she should see a doctor as to why she seems so aggressive towards me, and it’s only me. She’s a great mother, I try and show appreciation and try and give her space she travels to Jacksonville to see her mom a lot since where we live now she feels alone and says she has no one. I get where she’s coming from but I can’t deal with being treated like this anymore. It’s not physical or anything like that but she’s emotionally disconnected from me. She dosnt respect me, when she’s angry she says such hateful things to me and idk if she really means it. Right now she’s gone for a week which to be honest I’m happy for because I needed a break from her but I miss my son so much. I work 60+ hours and I feel like I never see him all I want to do is spend time with him as a family and he’ll be gone this whole week so I can’t even see him for the hour or two I see him before bed everyday. What’s worse is now my wife is getting even worse. It’s one thing for us to get divorced, I can handle that what’s more important is for us to be civil with each other and be great coparents because I want my child to have a healthy relationship with both of us. This weekend I went to Jacksonville and wanted to have our son just for a few hours Sunday to take him to see my parents since they rarely see him since my wife has been like this but she suddenly raged for like 3 seconds when I said can I take him with me, at first she said she already made breakfast plans with a friends and I said that’s fine I can take him after your plans, then she said no after she had more plans to hang with her mother to go shopping and more and I said well that’s fine but you don’t need him to go shopping and have fun with your mom let me take him it’ll give you a break and also let me have time to see him and my parents. She suddenly raged saying “NO I WANT HIM WITH ME” and I just sat there shocked. She’s never been that way withholding our child from me. I let it go for a couple of hours and brought it up again and mentioned she can’t keep our child from me like that I just wanted to visit my parents for a few hours I mean she’s going to be there this whole week and couldn’t give me 3 hours.  Sunday came and she ignored my texts didn’t respond to me and kept my child from me and I had to drive back home since I had work the next day. It’s getting too toxic and now she’s keeping my own child from me. Enough is enough but idk what to do. My life consists of work and coming home and that’s it, I’m perfectly fine with my life as long as I’m coming home to my family and not treated like I’m a monster.  I just want to figure out what to do.

MsMilarina,"I was diagnosed with PPD after I gave birth in June 2020, however I was due in August. My issue is that I keep reliving my childbirth and having violent thoughts. Thoughts like something horrible is going to happen and I can’t control it. Everything I do or want to do something comes along and changes the projectory. 

My pregnancy, the c-section and my postpartum all went south. I was hospitalized my 6 month due to Preeclampsia. I made it to 32 weeks and had an emergency c-section. Didn’t leave the hospital until July 3. My baby still in the NICU only for me to return back a week later with deep vein thrombosis (DTV) and a hematoma. Had another emergency surgery due to my DVT.   

It’s been almost 9 months and I feel worse off now than before. I was prescribed antidepressants and not sure if I should take them. I never felt this sad and anxious in my life. Some days I feel like I have my depression under control and then I’m back in that dark place again for weeks.

Top_Interaction8871,"Advice needed.

My brother and sister in law had their first son (OS) 3.5 years ago and second son (YS) 2 years ago.  Since then, my SIL has been a stay at home mum.  

My SIL is a good mum, but since OS was born some of her behaviour has odd and sometimes obsessive.  **We think SIL has PPD but we dont know what to do to offer help. And we are worried about my brother who is at exhausted physically, and emotionally.**

My brother is beside himself and not sure what to do - we are all super worried about all of them.   My brother wakes up, tends both kids, makes them breakfast, prepares their lunch, then goes to work for 8 hours, comes home to cook dinner, clean the house and put boys to bed. My brother is exhausted and desperate for a break.

**So i need some advice on how we can support both of them.**  My suggestion to my brother is that he talks to his doctor and raises his concern, or goes with SIL to doctor and shares his concerns with both to see what help both he and SIL can get.   And if this does not work (as he suspects that SIL will just double down that nothing is wrong), that he talks to SIL's parents thats he is concerned about SIL and why and ask them for support (but he's worried that not only will SIL double down, she will leave and/or isolate herself further).

Some examples of SILs behaviour.

 \- Talks about wanting to keep both boys babies as long as possible.  Wont go back to work, as this would be ""leaving them"".

 \- Any suggestion or feedback about either son, from brother, doctor, health nurse, kindergarten teacher, is taken as a criticism of my SIL as a mother.   For example, the kindergarten gives parents feedback on their children, this is just normal feedback on behaviour, colouring skills, etc.  My SIL took their feedback on OS as a direct criticism of her as a ""mother"". 

 \- Except for the 2 nights in hospital when having YS and now 1 hour a week when OS goes to Kindergarten, my SIL has NEVER been apart from her sons.   Not for coffee, not for catchup with friends or even date night with her partner (my brother).  

 \- Both boys are not allowed to play outside, they are kept in a 3x5m lounge room from the moment they wake to the time they go to bed; unless my brother forces SIL to take them to the park on the weekend.  When they do get taken outside by SIL, they are in the pram and stays there until they arrive home. 

 \- SIL uses TV as ways for the boys to engage, and as baby sitter, if she needs a quiet moment, e.g. for OS when she is tending YS, etc.

 \- SiL prefers the immediate family bubble, e.g. SIL, Brother, 2 Sons.  Prefers family not to visit.  Gets overly emotional and angry if people want to visit. Visits have to be scheduled weeks/months in advance. This includes her family and my brothers family. 

 \- SIL will rarely allow the boys to be alone with my brother, their father, as they are HER boys and have to stay with HER.  So even when brother tries to take boys to park to give SIL a break, this will cause a large argument about the boys being taken away from her.

 \- The boys are constantly bored as their world is limited; when they do get taken to the park, they are desparate to engage with any other child and become desparate to stay when being made to leave it.",Postpartum_Depression,Help with Sister in Law with PPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/m4ql92/help_with_sister_in_law_with_ppd/,1615732225.0,2021-03-14 07:30:25,

Docwifearchivistlife,"So I (FTM, 27) have a 5-week-old baby boy, Anthony. Yesterday I was diagnosed with PPD and my doctor is fairly certain I'm oxytocin deficient, based on a number of factors. I've been on Prozac for years, and we added Lyrica back onto my regimen (I stopped taking it when I got pregnant).

I feel like I can't connect to my son, like we're not bonded as we should be. It doesn't help that I cannot breastfeed. It doesn't hurt me or upset me when he cries, and I know that biologically it's supposed to. My mom heard him crying over the phone and said it was breaking her heart, whereas for me I was just meh (I was driving and couldn't do anything about his crying; I wasn't just letting him cry). I never feel like I want to smile or talk to him, it just feels weird and almost unnatural. I sing to him and read books, but that's it. Sometimes it just doesn't feel like he's my baby. Don't get me wrong, I love him, but it feels more as if he's a nephew of mine than my own flesh and blood. The super strong maternal bond just isn't there and I hate it.

My husband, on the other hand, is obsessed with our son, to a level I wish I could be. He's always saying to me, ""wife, I love this little boy so much. I just can't stop cuddling/kissing/looking at him."" And then it makes me feel ashamed that I don't always feel the same way. I love cuddling with him and he is so freaking adorable, but idk. It feels like he loves our son more than I do, and it's not supposed to be this way.

Obviously I don't want DH to stop showing affection to our son, but I almost wish he wouldn't do it in front of me, because it makes me feel so bad. Idk how I could ever ask him to do that. I just hope the Lyrica will help me feel better, and I hope I can find ways to bond better with Anthony.

LaBelleGiselle,"Hello ladies!
I am a STM, student, and need your help!

I have a 4-year-old girl that is on the spectrum and am currently 39 weeks pregnant with my second child. Ever since I can remember I have heard people say that every pregnancy is different. From my personal experiences, they seem to be right!

I had a very difficult first pregnancy, but I wanted to become a mother more than anything. After almost losing my child at 12 weeks I began to feel defeated, but that feeling lasted months after I gave birth. I never spoke to anyone about my postpartum depression, (PPD), but it almost made me feel detached from the child I fought so hard for.
Now, at 39 weeks, I can say I have been blessed with a very “easy” pregnancy (although I haven’t given birth yet, so we’ll see!) and it’s difficult to know if my PPD will come back.

These experiences prompted my study in pathology behavior, more specifically, postpartum depression (PPD). My group and I have developed a short survey that can help us with our research. If anyone is willing to take it please follow the link:

Brief_Series9604,"Hi everyone, I'm a 22 year old female college student getting my BA in Psychology and recently accepted to grad school to further my edu and get my Psy.D (yay). I am taking a course right now about treatments of mental disorders and decided to do my project on treating women with PPD. CBT versus antidepressants. I want to focus on treating peoples ""core beliefs"". These are one's core thoughts about themselves that basically affect everything in their life. Core beliefs are sort of a lens and people with these beliefs view everything differently. If anybody feels like sharing I would like to gather some core beliefs from women who are currently suffering with PPD to share with my class, I won't use names, usernames etc... of course. For example, a core belief could be ""I am not a good mother"" so that belief would affect every situation even though it is not true. If you feel like sharing, thank you I really appreciate it. I may not understand your struggles with PPD because I have never been a mother, but I see you and appreciate every mother out there. Also just to add there is of course no judgement from me. My goal is to be a clinical psychologist and do different types of therapies so I will never ever judge somebody for their mental disorders.",Postpartum_Depression,PPD Core Beliefs-research project,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/m1ajbi/ppd_core_beliefsresearch_project/,1615333659.0,2021-03-09 16:47:39,
Apprehensive-Fig405,"I had my baby girl January 25, about 6 weeks ago.

Difficult birth. Pitocin induction made it all the way to 6cm before epidural. Progressed to 8cm. Then i got a bizarre upper back pain that left me unable to move and therefore push. I always also in excruciating pain worse than I’ve ever experienced. Worse than pitocin contractions.

Ended up doing c section. I was knocked out with ketamine for it bc Xanax did nothing and I am a highly HIGHLY anxious person.

5 days agree birth, i realized i had pre eclampsia. I couldn’t breathe easily and had chest pains. In the middle of my feeling the first signs of post partum depression. I was hospitalized for 3 days and for me this was more traumatic than the birth.

I was just so scared the whole time. Scared of being a new mom. Scared of being away from my baby. Scared of not knowing what was wrong with me (pre diagnosis) and all these invasive tests and constant EKGS, blood draws (trigger for me), CT scans, and attempting to breastfeed at the time so pumping. I just felt SO drained. Like life was asking too much of me. I don’t adapt well to change and there was so much thrown at me.

Did i mention we’re closing on the sale of our house March 17th? We have to move out into a rental bc nothing good is on the market. Another stressful change.

My dad died of a sudden heart attack last Tuesday. So i flew across the country without my very young baby during covid. Went through the funeral. Am currently battling now difficult this is.

Also lost my very very beloved cat at 3 years old last May which was very traumatic for me. I still miss her too. I just don’t understand why life is such shit for me right now.

Sorry this was long and very pity party esq.... But i really feel like i can’t do this.

I don’t miss my baby. At all. I’m beyond at capacity. And i feel so guilty. But also so depressed and terrible. I’m the worst mom. I don’t even know how to function and be a good parent.

I have heard most of this secondhand, except for the detachment she feels towards her youngest (not 2 months old).  I don’t think she would ever harm her children, but I am still concerned.  Her pain is lashing out to everyone in her family (that she is living with). 

I’ve tried connecting and advising that she should seek therapy, but to be selective with therapists that specialize in this.  She agreed to go, I made myself a safe place to vent to...but it has blown up with her family.

Motherhood just like how it treated you is treating me the same way too. Everyday I learn something new. There are some days that are easy and there are others where I just want to lock myself up in the room and cry. It is a challenge that I was not prepared for no matter how many books I had read before the baby came along. There are days where I feel like a complete failure of a mum and there’s nothing I can do but move on and hope I do better tomorrow. Thank you for your question but no I do not wish to tell you how motherhood is treating me.

I get absolutely no help. I live with her dad and he never comes home after work. He’s either playing games with his friends or getting coked out.

Sparky-G97,"I don't know how to share my thoughts without feeling like I'm sounding annoying and asking too much for someone to listen, even to all you strangers I'm struggling to write this. 

Since the birth of my second child my mental state continually deteriorates. I did counseling, did the mood stabilizers, proper diet and exercise, SAHM, then tried full time working mom, change of place, change of friends, changed everything I could to not feel this anymore. With every new stone turned not producing results it gets a little worse. I had to cut my biological family out of my life due to a traumatic childhood and for the safety of my children. My friend group slowly fizzled out until there was no one left. Now I spend so much of my day trying and failing to dissociate enough to seem happy that everyone can see how unhappy I really am. This is taking a toll on my husband, he blames himself so much that I am terrified to tell him how empty I feel. I don't want him to internalize this. How do you cope with knowing every birthday of yours you'll get no calls, no visits, no cake. How do I come to terms with living for myself when I feel I have nothing to live for. My kids deserve far better than what I can ever offer them. I've dragged my husband down with me into this darkness. Outside of that I have not a single soul that wants to spend any time with me. Before I filled my time with hobbies and small joys, but despite loving my paintings, loving the food I make, loving the long drives, and especially the karaoke nights, no matter how hard I try I cannot love myself or love being alive. I'm so so tired. I hate loneliness above all else yet I'm lonely all of the time. I know my kids and my love need me and want me here with them always. It just hurts so so much being here fearing another 60-80 years of feeling this.

To backtrack, I had an overall pretty stressful third trimester as my existing high blood pressure all of a sudden became uncontrolled even w meds and I dually got diagnosed with gest diabetes at the same time. To top that off, they discovered a large cyst on my ovary. The BP was concerning enough that I got put on disability from work to be on home bedrest at 27 weeks...My 35-36th week was admitted to the hospital for hospital bedrest and finally delivered at 36 and 4 days. With all the checkups and drs I absolutely hated it, and it caused me so much shame that I couldn’t enjoy a “regular” 3rd trimester but I had a glimmer of hope as once this baby is delivered healthy, my pregnancy related health issues would go away as well.

Except my health issues didn’t go away. Cyst still there, probably needing to have surgery for removal. Blood pressure still high and uncontrolled. Diabetes officially diagnosed (just got my lab results today). PPD and PPA since delivering...The health issues seem endless...and so overwhelming.

taystee23," I had my first baby in October, a beautiful boy. He ended up having a lot of neurological problems because they said he had a stroke in utero. He lived his whole life in the hospital, because the doctors told me I had to make a decision to let him live a horrible quality of life. Or let him die peacefully.

  The only way he would have been able to go home with me was if he had multiple invasive surgeries to live outside of the hospital. A tracheotomy and a feeding tube in his stomach. He had severe severe brain damage. He wouldn't be able to eat without a tube or breathe without a ventilator. He would never be able to walk, talk, or sit up on his own. So I made the decision to take him off life support, thinking I was being the best mom I could to him. He was 3 months and 5 days old and so beautiful. He looked completely normal. 

 Ever since I had him, even before we took him off support I have suffered the worst depression and anxiety I've ever had in my life. I have nightmares and night terrors.

noclue92,"I'm a mom of three and I had no clue I had postpartum! I thought I was going crazy. I was men a lot of the time. I was a sad mess! I had a husband who loved me a healthy baby but I just didn't feel worthy. During my delivery I was bleeding out I saw my life flash before my eyes. I wasn't even a mom for five minutes and I was already so close to saying bye. thankfully with amazing doctors and nurses they reacted face and within three hours I was getting transfusions and nursing my baby. however the second day home is where it really went down hill for me! I tired to nurse my baby, I started feeling really hot, overwhelmed, sore, sad and disappointed with myself. The baby wasn't latching. then baby was crying and so was I! I was feeling like maybe I should've died during delivery I didn't feel like my baby loved me. I handed my little one to my husband so I could cry. In hopes it would get better it didn't. I had no clue that I would be dealing with PPD! I didn't even know it was a thing! when my doctor (new) I might add asked how I was doing after birth or if there had been anything life changing. I told her yes. I keep feeling overwhelmed and sad, plus two day after coming home I lost a favorite family member of mine to cancer in which I didn't know they were sick. She did nothing to help. she said ""sorry to hear that"" no lets see how we can help with it! I tell myself to this day if she had listened to me really heard the pain I could have been helped instead of feeling the way I did for so long. Sad, mean and angry! I will be honest I was horrible to my husband during that time but I also had moments where I did feel human. enough in fact no to long after we created another human. which lead to moire hormones, more anger, more sadness. I thought the whole time I was just crazy, a horrible person. I didn't think or look at as pregnancy hormones or PPD. I said the most hurtful things to him. that I didn't mean. it was like watching a movie play out and you can't tell the main character to SHUT UP!! I as the main character. After some huge fight I would have to sit alone to gather myself and think back to what I said to him. a lot of the time I was in shock at what I remembered saying. Most times he would have to remind me what I said. during my second pregnancy we found out I had a severe blood disorder that could affect the baby. we had to do so much blood work, two doctors visits a week. it was stressful. pregnancy, stress, a little one under one and hormones. You guessed it it made me even more of villain. I was home sad, alone, pregnant, with a toddler and just sad that I had to do alone while my husband was at work. No matter how hard I tired to be nice it was like a little demon who kept taking over what I wanted to say. I never wanted to hurt him ever. Because he is truly the first person in my life who haas shown me love! I knew from the moment I met him that I wanted to be his friend. that we would be best fiends. we connected so strongly! when he finally told me how he had feeling for me I was so happy because I like him too! from the moment we started dated we were together like glue. so the fact that I hurt him, said the thing I said, did the thing I did I feel awful everyday. Once our second baby arrived I thought I would be better. Boy was I wrong. it was a struggle living where we were. getting put down everyday by people who are supposed to love and support you. taking care of a one year old and new born all while trying to keep yourself together. I had so many days where I would tell myself to be happy! you love your kids, you love your husband and you fought to be here for them so why can't you just be NORMAL! I would tell myself to snap out of it your alive. why are you sad. But all I could see and feel about myself was unworthy, useless, helpless and just a gross body! which made me even more of villain to my husband. I was mad at him for saying I looked good because to myself I looked like a piece of crap. my stomach was pale and weird. my boobs where Huge with milk dripping out. I wish I could have taken him compliments but I couldn't something inside was telling me otherwise. that I was just some horrible ugly person. I tried losing the weight I gained but that 15 wouldn't go anywhere. I tired hard but nursing, being with a toddler I started to lose the focus to go work out, to eat health. I started snacking and grabbing what I could when I could. our living situation was still horrible so of course already feeling like shit about yourself and then having family telling you you're fat and lazy doesn't help. it didn't help me at all it made me cry  more, hate myself more and you guessed it made me take it out on my husband more. Things I would normally wouldn't get upset about you bet I was crying and texting him about it. I made him feel bad because I was felling down about myself. I had no one to turn to I wish I could've turned to him and told him how I was feeling but instead I would get anger at him. which was far. we never felt at home there. there was constant insults, yelling and people in the way. he feels like I never took his side but boy is he wrong. I would get into a huge rawr about how we didn't feel welcomed there. people would eat or food, wake or kids up. in the mist of all that we lost our privacy. I didn't feel like I could kiss him in the open, huge him, say I love you because of the remark I would get. we had to basically only be married in our room. I felt like we were teenagers living with them. fast forward you probably guessed it we were pregnant again. when had the same health scare as our second. a lot of doctors visits a lot of sadness but this time. he had a job that kept him a lot of long hours which meant I missed him allot more, which made me mad because I didn't get to see him as much. we had a lot of family trips which helped because it was the only way we could be alone just the four of and when the kids went to bed just the two of us. you also probably guessed it I wasn't nice this time around either! why you may ask well to be honest I don't know wanted to show how much I loved, respected and cared for him but something in me wouldn't let me. my love came off as joke or being mean and this isn't how I wanted them to. I prayed a lot after everyone went to sleep wherever I could a lot of the time it was in the tub. I would pray to go please help me get better! please help me be a better wife to my husband. I would also ask him, why did you help me come back if I was going to be this way. this isn't the wife I wanted to be in my head. I didn't know who this person was. it was consist black out after black in arguments. a lot of which I still don't remember. I have always hoped that my husband could forgive me because one day I would get better and be there for him the way I had always wanted to be. the new baby arrived one of my best deliveries! no complications everything went smooth. until it wasn't. I started getting the hot, overwhelmed, I hate myself and why do I look like this moment. the nothing I do is right feeling. the I just can't pull it together feel. I tried my best to be as aware as I could be honestly I don't remember much. fast forward to two years later still the same. thing I want to show him love it won't come out in the way I want it to. just jokes which he didn't take as love. finally I realized I really need help but then Im sacred if I reach out to someone they will think I'm crazy and take my kids away. I can do it on my own. almost a year later after struggling to get it together. we moved into out own place, I have been able to look at myself in the mirror with clothes on and off. I started to be able to show my husband love. I was able to get out off bed without being a reck that I would hear negative comments all day. I was able to play music and just love life. don't get me wrong I had moments where I would text him to complain but never because I wasn't happy. he was just my only friend. now he want a divorce and I don't. I'm finally a happy me, positive not angry a person I feel like he could really love. I feel so bad and hurt because so much bad has happened but we have also had so much good. I feel like now that I'm finally good we could try to get back to the us before PPD. I know he has a lot of hurt from the things that has happened because I have so much guilt. I just hope we are able to air it all out. oh I forgot to mention that over all those years we never talked out any of our fights. we would yell and yell it would go no where. then we would move on. unhealthy yup I know. which is why I'm happy he said he would do couple therapy with me. he said he still wants a divorce and I just want to be able to help him let go of all the resentment he holds against me and he can see now that I'm no longer that PPD angry person.",Postpartum_Depression,No Clue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/lmfrvu/no_clue/,1613654681.0,2021-02-18 06:24:41,

Schwebbers,"
I am a psychologist with a 5 month old son, and I am so sick of hearing all these Hollywood-myths about love and attachment that I believe are really unhealthy and create a lot of pressure for new parents, so please read this if you are a new parent struggling:

If you do not feel overwhelming love for your new born and/or if you did not feel euphoria at birth you are perfectly NORMAL / it is estimated that around 60% (!) do NOT feel overwhelming love and/or euphoria when they have a child and that is JUST FINE! You do NOT (nessecarily) have PDD if you feel like this - you have PDD if you have a depression! Actually - some people with PDD do feel quite a strong connection with their children, so PDD is about being depressed, not about the amount of love you feel! Let me tell you why there is absolutely nothing wrong with you for not feeling a lot of rainbows-unicorns etc: Attachment is a process like getting to know everyone else is a process. A lot of evolutionary studies suggest that we find babies most adorable from 6 months onward, probably because this is the time we began being quite sure they would survive on the savanna / in our cave / wherever our ancestors had babies. So being overly attached early on has simply not been evolutionarily beneficial - it is estimated that around 20% of all babies in prehistoric times would not make it passed the first 6 months of life, so it is really smart for us humans to attach slowly - securing our own mental well being when babies did not survive, or factoring the older children who we were already attached to and who had better survival chances if resources were limited. So please please please do not beat yourself up if all you are feeling is responsibility toward your newborn - because your feeling of responsibility is everything that baby needs to survive! Your bond will form over many months and years just like any other close bond. You are doing everything you need to be doing and you are doing GOOD ENOUGH!

And one last thing: The only time I ever feel overwhelming love for anyone is when the people I really, truly care about are very sick or in crisis. You are NOT supposed to feel overwhelming love for your children all the time (that sounds incredibly exhausting) - the strong feelings of love will pop up now and then and then go away again, just like every other feeling. What is important is that you continuously feel the need to take care of them and keep them safe. You bond will develop, you will feel love from time to time and you are NORMAL and you are ROCKING at parenting &lt;3

That’s all!",Postpartum_Depression,If you are a new parent please read this about love and attachment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/lhhbc5/if_you_are_a_new_parent_please_read_this_about/,1613061627.0,2021-02-11 09:40:27,

The guilt and embarrassment comes from my husband almost getting a vasectomy (yes that’s how serious we were about not doing this again) and from also telling anyone who asked that I would never do it again. I know at the end of the day who cares? But unfortunately I am one of those people who lives in a constant state of anxiety over what people around me say/think about me. And how will they respond and laugh when, “she said she would never have another child and look what happened.”

I journaled throughout my post-partum period to remind myself of how scary my thoughts were and how physically/mentally not there I was. And I go back and read my entries and cry because I don’t even recognize the shell of a person I was 3 months ago. And now I want to willingly do this again? I’m just really struggling with this mentally. 

Have any other of you wonderful mamas struggled with similar thoughts or feelings? All stories, advice, commiseration welcome.

BobbysueWho,I can’t function anymore. My little one is becoming so active and I don’t know what to do with her. I miss her nursing all day because than I have an excuse to be worthless. If she doesn’t want a but change or to nurse I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m so tired and so sad. If it were not for covid I would do things go to my family’s and ask for help ask them to come over. I am lost. My older sister had our middle sister come over every weekend when our nephew was this age. She could clean and do things while other people played with the baby. I am all alone for 12 hours a day and when my partner is home he just makes things harder because he is super messy and has adhd.

Myka261091,"I read and heard about PPA/PPD a lot and given that I had anxiety before my pregnancy I won't be surprised.

First of all, please don't judge me too harshly. I love my son to bits and I would even die for him but I think I really need help. I'm 8 weeks postpartum.

Today I was alone with my son as always on weekdays. I'm not breastfeeding so I was waiting for the formula to warm up and I played our usual game with my baby. He was practicing making funny faces and I was making funny faces too and talking to him. Before this I always laugh a lot and it was fun. But today was different. As he was making faces on me I suddenly got terrified. Of my beautiful baby boy. Suddenly his usually funny and sweet face seemed so intense and.... terrifying. I'm so ashamed to admit this. I needed to turn my head away from him and put him down in his nest, where I put him to get his food or other stuff. At first I tried to laugh it off, but then it happened again. I can't even describe what I got so terrified of. I read a few stories like this, but they were all specific thing - feeling trapped by the baby, afraid of losing him, afraid of doing something wrong. That's not my case. I was scared of him, as of his being.

I don't know what to do. I'm ashamed for feeling this way and I feel like my mind is just spiraling out of control. Does anyone have experience with something similar or I'm really going absolutely psychotic? Could it be the lack of sleep and food? Please help!",Postpartum_Depression,Please help!

korr919,"Apologies in advance for this rant! 

Let me say like everyone else, I am going through postpartum depression, my son will be 11 months old on Saturday, so I know I am acting a little crazy. But I can't help it.

So the issue is with my husband's dad and step mom. My father in law is a good guy, but he needs to learn boundaries. Him and my husband work together and he constantly calls my husband and also shows up at our house unannounced almost every weekend. (They are both mechanics and we have a shop and my father in law conveniently has side work at our house allllll the time). So needless to say I am so incredibly frustrated with him I am having a hard time reminding myself he's actually a good guy. 

The main issue though is with his bitch of a wife. My husband and I have been together for 13 years and the whole time she has been a miserable selfish bitch. Then when I got pregnant she literally said ""well I guess since there is a baby coming I better start being nice"". So she obviously knows she's a bitch. Now that my son is here all she does is complain about how she doesn't get to see him enough. I finally had to set a boundary of every other weekend for 3 hours, because for a while it was every weekend them calling about seeing the baby and leaving him longer and I'm just not willing to give up that much time with my son. I work all week and only get 2 hours a day with him on a work day, so my weekends are my time with him and I am very selfish with my time with him. I don't want him to grow up and look back and wish I would have been able to spend more time with him especially through his infancy, he changes minute to minute, I don't want to miss anything. 

I don't want him around her, i don't want her to influence him in anyway shape or form. She is a miserable human being who's only concern is herself. She only wants to be around my son because he's needy and it makes her feel needed, she made a comment one time about only wanting to take him on a walk in a stroller that has him facing her so he can look at her. Who TF says shit like that? She threw a fit one time because we didn't send him with any baby food and ""we are being selfish and keeping all the fun stuff for ourselves"". Meanwhile I'm pretty sure she is feeding him food without our permission I just don't have any proof so I'm not 100%.

Anyway, the jist of it is whenever we drop our son off, I have so much anxiety I feel like I can't breathe sometimes.  However I can't restrict how often she sees him anymore then I have. Just looking to see if I'm alone or not. I know a lot of people have issues with in-laws so I guess I'm also just wondering how you guys have gotten through it.

Idk where to else to put this and I have no one else to vent to. I had a baby on Oct 26, 2020 via c-section. It wasn’t the best experience honestly because my pain medicine wore off during my surgery. Anyway now I’m here 3 months later and I feel down everyday. Every second of my day goes to the baby. I never get any time to myself, showers and meals are luxuries at this point. I cry often, I’m either irritated, sad, or incredibly angry. The ONLY person I have patience for is my child but I’m starting to resent my husband and this life that I’m living now mostly because I told him so many times how much I didn’t want a kid yet, I’m only 22 and I haven’t lived life yet but we got pregnant anyway and Now I’m stuck in a house 24/7 with a screaming small human and I MISS ME!!! Idk who I am anymore other than a lady who wears throw up most of the day. My fiancé still gets to be himself, still gets to leave and do his hobbies and all I have is the baby. I have no sense of self it’s just baby baby baby all the time. I miss me! I miss how I looked I hate my body. I’m so insecure that I actively avoid and cover up mirrors and it feels like no one understands. No one calls and ask about me they only want to see the baby n if I try to talk about me they brush me off and talk about the baby. The baby is fine, IM NOT!! Some days I just wanna get my things kiss my baby and leave and I hate myself for feeling that way but damn I just miss me so much. I miss being able to shit in private and peace. I feel like I died on that OR table and another version of myself was born when my baby was born and I have no idea who that person is.

kinchous,"My labor took me about 24 hours and the contractions was one of the most painful things I've ever experienced in my life. I didn't expect that the post partum contractions would just be as painful. I knew I was going to bleed, I knew it was going to hurt, I knew it was going to be painful, but I think I was too naive to know that the uterus still kicks your ass as she tries to return to her original size.

I'm worried about this pain, how long will I feel crippled, how long will it be until I can walk without holding on to the wall or anything I can find. There's so many things I need to do around the house for the baby so just being immobile is giving me severe anxiety. Also all the pumping I need to prepare for my baby and just my baby in general. 

I'm not sure if I have PPD but this morning in the hospital I felt a severe emptiness. I looked at my baby that I love but I felt so empty. I'm not sure why? I guess it's probably hormones but it was such a weird feeling. Almost like someone reminding me that I've checked this of my list in life .... So what's next? I almost felt robotic. What a strange feeling that I'm not sure where it even came from when there's so much to look forward to. Maybe it's also fear of being a new parent and doing things right, whatever that may be? Maybe I'm scared from all the responsibility that is now on my shoulders... Maybe I'm scared I'll be a bad parent because I really don't know what to do as this is my first child.

JustAnotherLostMom,"I'm almost 10 months pp.. 13wks pregnant with baby #2 and i just can't seem to find the excitement over this new pregnancy.   
It wasn't planned, boyfriend and I had sex 1 time in a 4 month period and bam, I'm pregnant.  I know I should be happy.. considering my boyfriend has a history of cancer and was told he would never be able to have kids.. it took a year for us to conceive our son. So 1 time for this pregnancy is incredible.   If it wasn't meant to be happening then it wouldn't come so easily.. I know that.  

I am really hating myself for feeling so down about this pregnancy. 

What is wrong with me? What kind of mother am I? What kind of mother doesn't get excited about her pregnancy? I'm really beating myself up over this. 

I know I will love this baby more than anything and I know I am going to be a mom that does anything and everything... but how can I stop feeling like I don't want to be a mom anymore? 

I love my son, why am I so unbelievably depressed to the point I cry and I don't want to exist? 

I cry every day cause I can see and feel how much I'm already missing of my sons life because of this depression.  My OB won't allow me to have anxiety meds because I'm pregnant.

misstulip97,"Ive EBF my baby since hes been born so that made my period stop amd eventually come back 10 months postpartum. Since then Ive had the absolute worst anxiety amd depression. Panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, feeling like im losing it, irritability. I got so stressed out i lost a lot of weight and became severly underweight. I also was going through a traumatic experience, covid, civil war, economy collapse, postpartum health issues, my toddler and baby were extremely hard to deal with all alone. I had no one. 

Fast forward to now..a year and a half postpartum. I still breastfeed but less and out of that crazy situation i was in. However my mood is crazy depending on my cycle. After my period im extremely depressed. Before it i have severe anxiety. During the period its both but less. I only have 1 week a month i feel normal-ish. 

I am now starting to wean him off in hopes ill feel better. Since getting out of that situation ive slowly been getting better but im not myself yet.

Tight-Living-5739,"First off this is gonna probably be pretty long but im about to go crazy if I dont vent in some shape or form. I have to start this off by saying. (because this will be important later) That I was molested A LOT by several different family members and have gotten older (20) and realized there were alot of adults who were doing inappropriate things that I just didnt register as a child. So to start this off when I was 6 I moved from South Carolina to Tennessee because my mother got locked up and my grandmother didnt want my father to keep us (with good reason) . I also believe but have not got clarification that we left due to the 1 molestation incident that my family actually knows about . i have scars to this day from me ripping in my private areas . it was one of the worst. after moving to Tennessee I had a rough time here because for one im in a really blantly racist town and im in a area I am not familiar with. I did not get along with my mother even one bit and my father was not involved in my life by his choice . I did not and do not speak to any of my family members due to the molestation by my cousins. When I turned 18 I left for college which was a good 3 hours away from anyone I knew and given my relationship with my family it didnt seem like a big deal but more like a relief from toxicity. Shortly after moving I ended up having to pick up a extra job while also going to school . I was constantly exhausted but couldnt get rest because I had to pay bills. I ended up meeting a man at work , 39 years old that offered to essentially pay my bills and buy me food for company . and thats exactly how it started for a while. he bought me food , clothes , took me shopping , bought me a range rover etc and then one day I got drunk with him. I thought I could trust him but when I woke up I could tell I had been violated sexually. I tried to play it off cool and let him leave but I went in the bathroom and cried . I decided I wasnt gonna talk to him until a few weeks later when I came to find out I was pregnant. so I had to come up with a new plan. I decided I would try and finesse the situation by using the pregnancy as a way to get him to buy me a new apartment, furnish it , and give me some extra money and just get a abortion and cut him off . My lease ended in a month and I felt like that was the perfect opportunity. he agreed to get me these things and everything was as good as it was gonna get given the circumstances. I started to pack my things the first friday of may I believe , unfortunately I took too long and we werent gonna be able to make it to sign the lease that day so he told me he rescheduled for me to go and sign on monday and that we would just get a hotel until then. After ive gotten all my things into the car we drive to a hotel , everythings calm. we dont have sex , we just eat and talk. when monday comes he drives to nashville and pulls up to centennial park and parks. he then proceeds to tell me that he has been homeless this entire time and just didnt tell me because he knew I wouldnt talk to him if I knew that. he then talks about how he just didnt want to be alone in the situation. (being homeless) I get mad , cusss him out and he leaves me in the car , at a place I dont know anything about and gets drunk. when he comes back , because I had no choice to sit there , mind you , i was also in shorts and a tank top and men were already whistling at me which brought up my sexual trauma, he comes back and hes drunk . really drunk and tries to drive. I  tell him no and use my pregnancy as a excuse as to why he shouldnt drive with us in the car like that . he snatches the keys from me anyways and drives off with one of my legs hanging out . I close the door and just pray to god he doesnt wreck in nashvilles traffic . well he gets mad that im not responding to him and kicks me out of the car in the middle of the highway. im stubborn so I get out of the car and grab my phone . I begin to walk and he chases me in his car and begs me to get back in . at this point i see that this man is bipolar and violent  and I will just take my chances with the streets . pregnant or not. I manage to run through some grass and across some buildings so that he can no longer find me in his car. I look at my phone , its at 1% . it dies the moment I try and make a call. as im walking I realized ive walked a complete circle and ended up on the backstreet back to the park . (might be why he gave up on chasing me now that I think about it) and I see his car. windows down and he always leaves the key in because he will shoot anybody messing with his car. I tried to sneak up to the car but i had on bright colors and was easily seen . he sends two men over to me to get me to “talk to him” which I now realize was just a intimidation move . I told him my fear of men , especially sexually and he used that agisnt me often. I ended up staying unfortunately. I know it seems stupid but I was scared . he used to be a drug dealer in the area when he was younger and know alot of the men around there and I was afraid if I left I would end up getting raped or something so I rather of stayed with the rapist I atleast knew versus be raped by a random. thats crazy now that I say it but thats the truth. on top of the fact I dont talk to any of my family because of the resentment I hold towards them for the things that happened to me previously. from that point forward we were homeless for months and this man made 25+ dollars a hour. I had to have sex with him and be lovey dovey with him in order to eat , sleep in a comfortable spot, be left alone etc . if i didnt he would have me sleep under picnic tables , in the rain , not eat , he wouldnt let me wash no matter if i did what he said or not because of some fetish he had and he wanted me to smell bad. he actually would Ejaculate inside of me and not let me wash that out. he refused to stop doing that.  which to me was both just another way to degrade me. He even had complete control over my phone so I couldnt contact my family. 


we ended up getting in a wreck memorial day/weekend and I got threw over a guardrail . I bled from that point forward vaginally and believe I lost one of my babies from that. a drunk driver hit us while broke down on a highway . I ended up getting 3k from the insurance company from that . I didnt get but maybe 200$ out of that in which he made me spend on wigs and new clothes bexause he was “embarrassed “ of how i looked now. shortly after he had my money he took me to a cook out and said it was a bunch of his family there . I had no other choice but To go since I depended on him solely for everything. I was pretty big at 3 months. and he refused to get me any prenatal care . (so much so that I went into labor a couple months later and got refused at multiple hospitals for anything because I had no prenatal care) 


we get to the cookout and all these family members are actually a big ass congregation of people who molested me . no exaggeration. he knew of my abuse and brought me there anyways . and I feel like that was a way of him belittling me some more . he then later got drunk and asked me if I remember him . and I asked him what he was talking about . he then admits that he tried to talk to me when I was 16 about to be 17 and I blocked him because of his age . and when I really sat and thought about it I actually did remember his face from somewhere. so for the next couple of months until october I was being taken advantage of by him and forced to have a baby i dont want . I ruined my body . ive lost all of my life . I never had a chance to live my life to begin with and now I got a baby so its like I cant do anything that normal 20 year olds are doing because im too busy changing diapers that I shouldnt even be changing . im not even really attracted to men. 95% of my attraction is women. he tried to convince me to be a prostitute because “pregnant women have the wettest coochies “ . and i would make alot of money and could get us out of homelessness 😐 he wouldnt let me get a job and if i made a interview appointment he would mysteriously have a reason for me to miss it. it was his car, I didnt really know how to drive and I didnt have my license . due to the bleeding during my pregnancy, I assumed my babies were dying or I was having a still birth . so I tried to drink or smoke those thoughts away and he facilitated a space for me to do so due to me not being old enough to buy those things . I eventually got home to my mother after he got offered a better job in another state ,  where he still came around to “check up” on me . my mother only found out about the drunk assault yesterday. I have pressed charges against him but it wasnt until a couple months later and I dont have any evidence. so im depressed about that. also now that I have a son , hes trying to get custody/visitation rights and I honestly dont trust him around my son and dont want my son to be anything like him. he mentioned before that since I  was having his baby I would always have to be involved with him and I cant help but think the only reason he wants visitation is so that he can have some type of hold over me.

i’m almost 5 months ppd and i have a confession to make...
when i was pregnant and in my 2nd trimester , i really felt awful of how i looked and started using this camera app to make myself feel better about myself...
smaller face,bigger eyes, clear skin, by then i started to feel better and took pictures of myself. come the time i gave birth and i saw my baby,she’s so precious and beautiful and i just love her! as a parent we want to take photos and videos of our child/ren to treasure the memories,so i took hundreds upon hundreds of photos and took videos of her cause she was just so cute! Earlier this day i started to print some of her photos to make a photo album,and as see them on print i was staring at it and i thought “wow she looks so pretty here!” small face,big eyes,clear skin...in that moment it started to sink in and my heart just dropped..I USED THE SAME CAMERA APP TO MY BABY! i felt so horrified of myself and i feel so guilty, i got so used to using the app that i unconciously used it on my baby too! i am just devastated and horrible of myself now..how could i distort her precious image at such a young age! what have i done....now i want to delete all the pictures and videos i took of her because i could not bear to make her look in the future of my own distorted image of her and make her feel insecure of her looks...i love my baby so much and i just feel so aweful i’ve been crying for quite a while now...all those precious moments,ruined by my own hands...i wanna disappear..",Postpartum_Depression,Confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/l6tz4l/confession/,1611856725.0,2021-01-28 10:58:45,

dedestro417,"Let me start this off with the fact that I know I’m in the wrong but I can’t seem to get my head on straight.

I’ve been married to my wife for 3 years. We waited to have a baby for 2 years then suddenly we both looked at each other and realized we couldn’t think of any reasons to wait. We both wanted a child. Fast forward 9 months. We had an amazing pregnancy and were crazy excited. Home birth went great, wife is healed up, and sex life is normal already. No issues right? 

I’m sitting on my couch crying. I don’t really know why. Our baby is happy, my wife is happy, my job isn’t at risk, and I have tons of stuff to do... if I want. I don’t. I hate working, I hate sitting at home doing nothing, I hate going out to do something. My wife spends most of the time with our baby which makes sense. It needs her. When he’s napping I get her to myself for 2 hours at a time so I have no reason to complain. But for some reason here I am. I sit here in silence but I hear a static and ringing in my ears. It’s so loud it must be deafening but I hear all other noises perfectly well.

I came here to post because I know I should be happy too. I literally have it made. I’ve never had any sort of depression until I got married. Since then maybe one day every 3-4 months I’ve been absolutely bored out of my mind and nothing gave pleasure but I take that as a typical easy life boredom and it lasts a day at most. If this was a one day thing I wouldn’t have posted either but this has lasted a week and I think I may need help. 

I don’t care how you give it to me. Maybe I need some straight up “get off your ass” style support. I just need something. Some guy wrote a post 93 days ago that I read. It was nice to know things got back to normal for him. I’m sure they will for me too.

cherrylea,"Just when I thought I was getting better, life decides to be extra hard and give my grandma COVID-19, keep her in a hospital for a month and never let her out again, at least in life. 

I have switched meds so many times that I don’t want to take them anymore. But I do cuz it helps. Somewhat. I started talking a mood stabilizer twice to see if my emotions can be in a straighter line instead of being so extreme in each end. Sometimes I think I’m bipolar tbh.  Anyways, Is it helping? I have no clue. I have had more depressive episodes in a week than I did when I got diagnosed. I’m starting to feel that despair feeling I did when I got diagnosed. Everything feels dark. 

What sucks the most is that when I get mad or angry or frustrated or anything negative I yell (thanks mom and dad, even if you choose not to remember and call me dramatic and call every memory I have good or bad trauma but in a derogatory way) my daughter gets scared even when The issue is not with her. She ran away and said the word scared after I yelled at our dog for nipping at her (she’s fine. She’s not hurt, but she keeps messing with him no matter how we tell her or how many times). I have yelled at her and god is so hard to admit. The guilt is eating me especially after she expressing she was scared. 

I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. Just a couple of days I wanted to self harm, but I couldn’t find my knife. Today the dreaded thought crossed my mind “I want to kill myself” but I don’t and I won’t. I can’t caused my family that kind of pain. I can’t let my daughter grow without her mami.  

And now my husband lost his job and I won’t be able to go to therapy until he gets another job. (I’m a sahm and a student) 

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t know if it’s the new medication or not taking ssri anymore. 

I went from Zoloft 125mg to Wellbutrin 300mg. We decreased Zoloft little by little. Because my body was having withdrawals and giving me brain zaps, they put me on lexapro 10mg and then reduced it to 5mg. Then they added gabapentin 600mg for restless leg syndrome caused by ssri. Now I don’t take lexapro anymore and started a mood stabilizer that I take twice daily.

Madhamsterz,"I don't know if writing this will help, but I don't know how to use up my seconds in the day. 

I am convinced my deep depression is from covid brain damage. My depression fell heavy week two of having covid in November when baby was 3 weeks. I feel nothing but despair. I feel empty. I have no soul. It feels like I died with Coronavirus, that it actually stole my personality. I can't cry. I can't even express emotion through crying. I feel no joy.. not an ounce of joy for months. I feel impaired.

I can't concentrate. I don't know what's going on around me.. I know its common for moms with PPD to think their babies would be better off without them, but I actually believe this is true... If I am brain damaged and mentally ill from this virus, my being near the baby will harm her.

Her father loves her, but I wish I could give her a two parent home or happy family. I'm so despairing that we got this virus and that my neurological system is messed up. Seeing pictures of myself when pregnant pre covid breaks my heart, I was happy then. I want to scream into the picture to tell her to stay at her parents' house, not to move in with the father of the baby because he brought corona to them. It all seems so final and damning and hopeless. That the happiest time of my life would be followed by the most miserable. And that as hard as I tried to avoid the virus, it got me and had life altering effects.

I have a therapist, have been hospitalized at a psychiatric hospital, am on medication, and have tried and will try whatever I can. At this point I'd let them cut my brain open for a chance at feeling even a day of joy again, instead of this empty nothingness dread. I don't want my baby to suffer!  I wish she could be adopted by a loving happy family... instead she has a brain damaged mom who is obsessed with what happened to her and can't even control her own mind anymore. 

Im considering moving out so that she never has to see me like this.. Like maybe I see her a few times a week and push out whatever energy and fake smiles I have so that she doesn't have to see when I'm so miserable and disconnected. 

Life feels so unfair. I clawed my way out of so much to only be sent to this terrible place. 

Im so jealous of people who got over corona or never got it. I hate myself for catching it. I blame myself for allowing it to ruin me.

Background-Bear-5849,"In June 2019 my husband and I had our first baby. A month later, we moved to a different state. I was extremely anxious about this move because I wasn't familiar with the area/knew no one there, I was recovering from a pretty traumatic delivery/birth, and I was a new stay at home mom to a one month old baby. About a month after we moved, I began having physical symptoms such as dizziness and just feeling off. At my postpartum checkup, my dr did a cbc &amp; checked my iron, which was normal. I thought it was just from breastfeeding or lack of sleep at first. Eventually, the dizziness went away, but I started feeling really weak and drained. I went to the doctor again who thought it could be postpartum anxiety and I started taking a low dose of Zoloft (which I took until September of 2020). Throughout this time, I would have good days and bad days with my symptoms. Some months even were better than others. In July 2020, we moved back to our home state. After I weaned my son completely from breastfeeding in October, I started feeling worse. I just feel weak and drained most days, kind of like when you have the flu but no other symptoms, just the weak feeling. It is worse in mid morning/afternoon and gets a little better in the evening. Some days I will have a good day where I don't feel it as much, and other days I feel so bad I just want to lay down all day. The fatigue also gets much worse during my period, like I feel like I can barely function I get so weak for the first few days. I went to the doctor and had blood work done (CBC, CMP, thyroid panel, iron panel, ferritin, vitamin d), all came back fine.

I've struggled with PPD and PPA since my son was born almost 11 months ago. I am in telehealth therapy sessions, on meds, and overall doing well. 

Recently my fiance and I hit a rough patch financially. 28 days ago, two users on reddit reached out to me via one Assistance post to help with my son. 

I have never been more grateful in my life! A day ago I posted a thank you to the sub, and a user reached out to help me. I accepted the help under the condition I'd comment on their recent post saying they'd helped me.

Well, now I have mods and other users attacking and downvoting me over $10 for groceries...I returned the money yesterday as soon as the chaos began, and have sent proof of this to the mod that requested it, but since then my inbox has been blown up calling me every name in the book. 

I am in tears. I didn't ask for any more help, I was simply accepting an offer from a fellow mom....f me I guess for accepting unsolicited help, which has been so hard for me and has been something I've worked for years on with my therapist....just want to curl up and cry right now

I had my son 16 months ago and throughout those 16 months I have struggled profoundly. Complete meltdowns, waves of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, rage, the worst sense of impatience I have ever experienced, regret, frustration and just overall a sense of struggle that I can’t shake off. 

My son was 6 months old when COVID became apparent and before then I made sure to sign him up for infant swimming lessons, mom &amp; baby singing groups, anything I could. Boom, in an instant everything fizzled away. cancelled.

my boyfriend, son and I lived with my dad to save for a home but they worked all day long and everyday I was alone. alone alone alone. bored, struggling, nervous to be around my son all day. waking up dreading another day alone, having to plan activities for us, trying to get out of the house but having to turn back due to my son crying bloody murder the minute we left the house. (absolutely hated car rides)

Fast forward today. I’m feeling so absolutely empty and so uninspired. Scrambling to fill my days with activities, signing him up for anything I can (covid permitting)

Still so nervous to spend my days alone with him. Never feeling in the moment, happy, enjoying play time with him. 

I hate the way motherhood has been so far and I can’t help but look at pictures of new first time moms and wish I could do it all over again and change things. I just feel like i’ve done so much wrong from the start. I just feel so negative about myself and my parenting. 

I have no friends, my mom passed away from sulfide 2 years ago, I try to make friends but I can’t seem to keep them around. I’m caring, I’m kind, I’m bubbly, but it’s like I’m a repellent or something. 

I just want life to feel easier and to enjoy my son and to enjoy my life as a mom, not constantly comparing myself to others and wishing my life away.

JTZ86,"I’m 5.5 months postpartum with my second child. I have a three year old daughter and a 5.5 month old son. I was feeling great until he turned 4 months old. Then the PPA/PPD hit me like a ton of bricks. Now all I want to do is run away and I regret having him (even though he’s a pretty good baby). I’m just so sick of thinking about sleep/naps/feeding/schedules/wake windows/etc. All I do is think about his sleep to the point that I can’t sleep myself. I watch the monitor with every nap. I sleep trained him for night but I still wake up at like 5am and start watching the monitor scared he might wake up and now that will affect my day. I can’t live like this. Last night I woke up at 3:45am for no reason other than my anxiety was through the roof. 

He sleeps ok. Naps are a bit challenging and he sleeps about 10.5 hours at night without any night feeds. I just can’t shake this. I had PPD/PPA with my daughter but felt better by 5 months. I can’t believe I’m feeling WORSE as he gets older. 

I’m already on Zoloft and seeing a psychotherapist. I’m just obsessed with his sleep and how it might impact the next day or the morning or my own sleep.

Any moms have any advice on getting through postpartum depression/anxiety? I'm not pregnant yet but I am definitely at risk for PPD/anxiety but I don't want to let that get in the way.

Playful_Jellyfish_12,I’ve always had depression. I’ve always been on Zoloft. My daughter was born at the beginning of January 2020. Then the pandemic hit. I was doing okay. I mean it was summer at least...around 9 months when I got my first postpartum period my mental health started really going downhill. I started drinking more and more. I’m finally 4 days sober after a really rough week...I hate myself and I think I’m the worst mother in the world. I’m alone all day everyday. My boyfriend doesn’t get home till 5 pm. Immediately goes and takes a “short” shower that ends up being 30 mins. At night I have to sleep alone because he snores so horribly I won’t sleep. Not that it matters because my daughter still wakes 2-4 times a night. My friends are all too busy for me with work and their lives. I feel utterly alone. And her comes my guilt and depression yet again. Why can’t I enjoy my daughter all day instead of staring at the tv half of the time? Why can’t I be one of those mothers who LOVES to be a stay at home mom all day? I love my daughter more than anything but I am so severely depressed. I do not want to harm myself or others. I just can’t stop crying and feeling down. I’m afraid I’ll drink again. I have an appointment with my OB coming up and I pray he can help. I’m so scared.

shmimeathand,"I had the worlds most perfect pregnancy, after living with a debilitating autoimmune disease my whole life my pregnancy brought me relief, for the first time I felt normal and GOOD. I had almost no pregnancy symptoms aside from mild SPD in the last few weeks. I was happy, energized, I had clear skin and little anxiety, I felt purpose and I was connected with my baby. My pregnancy was the easiest part of this whole journey and I didn’t realize it at the time. My birth went all wrong. It started out perfect, I went into spontaneous labor, my contractions were totally bearable, I was thinking I would get all of the things I wanted for my birth plan. But then I asked for an epidural, and it took 5 tries to place it while I felt the catheter moving in my spine, with in minutes of it being placed my sons heart rate tanked into the 60s, I spent two hours flipping every few second, watching the monitors as dozens of strangers poured in and out of the room shaking their heads. My boyfriend was terrified and I found myself having to stay calm for him even though I thought my baby was going to die inside me. I had procedures being performed on me with no explanations and then a doctor tells me I’m being taken for a csection. I sobbed and shook, I was terrified we were both going to die, I hadn’t planned for this. I didn’t get all the things I wanted out of my birth plan, no golden hour no skin to skin no seeing my boyfriend cut the cord etc, I didn’t hold my son for almost an hour, I had an allergic reaction on the operating table and could hardly see him I was in so much pain, I was high from the drugs, shaking and itching uncontrollably in the recovery room, I barely remember any of it. The first few nights the combination of pain meds and oxytocin had me nodding out every few minutes, I could barely hold my son I was terrified I would pass out with him in my arms. 

Then came breastfeeding. I left the hospital with bloody scabbed nipples, I hadn’t felt the pain because of the round the clock meds. The baby wasn’t latching right, I had vasospasms and developed thrush. I spent weeks in the most horrifying agony I’ve ever felt. I reached out to lactation consultants, family members, local la leche members, I received no help. No responses. The same people who pressured me saying I “HAD TO BREASTFEED” completely left me hanging. I was in agony, I was exhausted, my baby was frustrated and never satisfied. He wasn’t growing.  I felt like a failure. I dreaded feeding him. I wasn’t bonding with him. I hated breastfeeding. The baby would only sleep with his dad, only be calm with his dad. With me it was just frustration, being forced to try and latch over and over again, never getting it right. Sucking and sucking and never getting enough. 

Breastfeeding was destroying me mentally. But so was the idea of stopping. It was something I had always assumed was just going to be easy, just like my pregnancy. I never gave any thought to it NOT working. I didn’t buy any “back up” formula, I didn’t learn about anything other than breastfeeding. Thinking about all the people who would think I’m a failure and think I just gave up, all the people who had pressured me, I felt guilty that I cared about their opinions. What kind of mother am I that I am worried about THEM and not my son who is struggling, or my son who’s mother was struggling. 

I cried and cried and cried. My eyes burned. Every day was worse than the last. 

So I finally decide to add formula. But the formula makes him gassy, unsettled. He seems like he’s in pain. I feel guilty. Like I’ve poisoned my son. He tolerated breast milk just fine, sleeping 6 hour stretches when his dad fed him bottles of pumped milk. Now he writhes, grunts and strains all day. Why could I just give him what he wanted. 

Why is it one step forward two steps back? Why is nothing going right for us. My boyfriend is infinitely a better parent than I am. He’s calm and understanding, the baby feels his energy and relaxes instantly. With me it is just anxiety. Uncomfortable. 
I am flailing and failing. I am a mess. 

Every day I want my baby to be older, because I blindly believe it will be easier. I feel guilt for feeling that way. I am going to miss him being this small. I am not cherishing this time because I am constantly lost, sad, frustrated. I spend every waking moment googling, reading, searching for answers. I can’t stop. 

I miss being pregnant. It was the easiest part of this whole thing. I love my son.

I have a mood disorder and was treated for it medicinally until I had an emergency c section. I had to immediately taper off PP because they were hitting me a million times harder with the hormone drop. I could hardly hold my baby and knew I needed to fast track to something more sustainable ASAP. 

Three weeks. Three weeks of no meds. The doctor handling my mental health literally left the practice as I was having my child. So within the four days I was in hospital, I was suddenly without my mental health care team. Nothing to treat PP panic, nothing for this horrible depression. There were no referrals like promised. 

I literally and I mean literally don't think my marriage will survive. My spouse is making my blood absolutely fucking boil. And it's not him, I'm aware. He's no saint, but I'm obsessing over the craziest shit. Like his former sex life with exes. Christ, even his HS gf. Beyond that everything he does feels wrong or hurtful. I'm jealous of everything and just cry or get angry. Usually both. I feel insecure and hideous and even right now we are on the verge of him leaving to go to his mom's house.

Fun-Watercress2603,"I am 36 and just found out that we are pregnant this past week. It was a very unexpected surprise for us, as my husband was preparing to schedule his vasectomy for next month.

This will be baby number 3 for us, and I honestly don't know that we can continue this pregnancy because of the suffering I experienced after our second child was born. 

I didn't have it after my first, but with my second, the PPD was severe and devastating. I was a panic-filled shell of a person for the first four months of my second child's life. Panic attacks hit all day long. I couldn't leave the house. I cried every day feeling like I was the worst failure of a mother. I had trouble bonding for the first NINE WEEKS of my baby's life. I couldn't sleep when it was time to sleep. I became underweight from an inability to eat because I was so stressed and depressed.

It is true to say that I have PTSD from that experience, even though I have recovered fully and am so in love with my second child I just want to hold them in my arms all day long.

I know that it isn't permanent. But I am filled with such grief and sadness and fear over the thought of even potentially experiencing that again.

driven_under666,"Hey mamas. I see you. I know you are struggling. I know this is hard. This sucks right now. I am here to tell you: this gets better. It gets better. The post partum depression gets better. It becomes manageable. It will eventually go away. But you need help.

I have been struggling with PPD for the past 7 months (my son is 11 months). It took me 4 months to muster the courage to even reach out to my midwife and ask for help, and admit my mental health was deteriorating. It was hard to ask for help - probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. My midwife was understanding, compassionate, and prescribed me Lexapro in conjunction with a referral to a psychologist who specializes in women's health &amp; wellness. It has been 2.5 months since I've been on medication and in therapy. It has been life-saving. Getting help allowed me to regain my sanity, my clarity of thought, and start moving in the right direction for better overall health. I am a more present mother, a happier wife, a more productive employee, and a kinder friend. I feel like the cloud of PPD has lifted and I'm out of the deepest ditches of it. I still have PPD, I still have bed days, but therapy and medication have helped me be self-compassionate and patient. Now, instead of spiraling out of control into panic attacks and uncontrollable crying fits, I ride the wave of the bad day/increased depression. I tell myself it will pass, and it does. I am now stable enough mentally to start focusing on my physical health and nutrition. Before getting help, I was simply existing as a fragmented version of myself. Now, I am surviving and I am making progress to start thriving. 

Mamas, please ask for help. You need it. You deserve it. Your baby needs you to get help, and your baby deserves a mama who is healthy. Please know: it gets better. It really does - and I know it does from personal experience.

Quick story time: I’m 20 years old, had a baby boy in April 2020. My sons father and I were together throughout my whole pregnancy and even before that. I found out one day before my maternity shoot that he cheated on me before I got pregnant.. it totally broke my heart. I decided to stay and forgive him. 3 months later, my son was in fact 3 months old, that my sons father comes back from work and he showered, ate and fell asleep. It was about 4am and I was up feeding the baby when I hear his phone go off. He got a notification from Instagram from a woman and again I found out he cheated on me. 

I ended up leaving him and honestly it broke my heart that I had a broken family with my son being so young. I come from one so I didn’t want my son to go through the same. I should mention that I had postpartum depression as well. I fell heavily depressed, and I know I need to get up off my ass and go back to college and get a job for me and my child.

Although becoming a mum can be a wonderful experience, it can also be a stressful and difficult time. We are interested in understanding what is important to new mums and seeing if there is a relationship between our personal values and the experience of low mood/postnatal depression.

If you are a new mum (18 and older), currently experiencing low mood/depression and **are not** currently receiving support from a mental health team, we would like to invite you to take part in our study.

This **anonymous online study** takes approximately 15 minutes to complete and as a thank you for your time we are offering participants the opportunity to enter a draw to **win 1 of 3 £25 Amazon vouchers.**

For more information or to participate in this study please follow the link: [https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_eDJquYKsC2KMFE1](https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eDJquYKsC2KMFE1)

Any support you can give with this study would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read,

QueenElizabeth13,"Hello all! I am new to this subreddit and I am hoping to connect with some of you who may have dealt with similar issues as I have.

I gave birth to my daughter in July. I had a relatively easy pregnancy and delivery. After she was born, I was on cloud 9. I felt wonderful. But that all came crashing down 3 months later after a health scare with my husband - something that wasn't even a huge deal. Ever since that day it has been like a switch was flipped and I am constantly worrying. Panic all day every day. I have very little enjoyment in life. I am back at work and being here is toxic for my mental health but I have to keep my job for the benefits.

I have dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life but what I am dealing with is a whole new level. Prior to what happened, I hadn't been medicated in several years as I was able to function without it. I started therapy and even my counselor suggested I see my OB to possibly get on a medication that was safe for breastfeeding. My OB has been a huge help. I am now on Welbutrin which has helped but I feel fucking terrible any time I am away from my baby.

My parents watch my daughter while I am at work. Both at 66 and I constantly worry about them, their health, what if something happens to them while they are watching my daughter, when are they going to die, etc. I can't afford child care and there is no way in hell I would trust my first child to a daycare where I live even if I could afford it. I am a wreck. I thankfully have some resources that I can take to possibly start working from home, which will help but I am so tired of feeling the way I do. Even when I am with my daughter, anxiety, and depression are still there. I want to enjoy my days again. I want to enjoy spending time with my family and my daughter without my heart constantly racing and thinking these irrational thoughts.

I had planned to have a second child but this has made me consider being a one child family. I don't want to go through this again if I am able to get out of this funk. Some days are better than others but I just want to feel the happiness I felt before. I want my life back.",Postpartum_Depression,My PPD/A is out of control,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/krsg3p/my_ppda_is_out_of_control/,1609979034.0,2021-01-06 17:23:54,

Mission_Protection98,"I (f23) had a horrible pregnancy, morning sickness all the way until the birth, but I lucked out with the birth. Barely 15 pushes, 0% pain and I was fully healed after 10 days. My son only wakes once in the night around midnight to eat/ be changed and then sleeps till morning. He's a happy, healthy baby. 

I should be grateful I'm so lucky but I hate him. I hate that he needs to be on top of me 24/7. I hate that my house is dirty bc I can't put him down. My dog needs attention and I have no time/energy to give it. I'm barely eating. Barely keeping myself clean. My hair is almost never brushed. I don't have any love for him. When he cries I have to remind myself to do something about it bc it doesn't actually bother me, I just know he shouldn't be crying. I also don't know any of his cries. I can't tell what he needs, I'm just going through the motions. I don't look at him and think how much I love him. I just want him to go away. I want him to never have existed. And I hate myself even more for feeling this way. Me. The person who grew up only wanting to be a mom. The one who never stopped talking about wanting to be a mom. The one who people barely knew but still knew as a future mom. I literally wanted to be a mom up until I was pregnant. Then I realized what it truly meant. I thought I knew because I basically raised my 5 siblings. I guess I never realized how hard a newborn is and what it meant. I really hate myself for begging the gods to let me get pregnant.

Mission_Protection98,"I went from parenting my 5 younger siblings and 2 cousins to having my own son. I never took a break and being a parent feels like the only thing I've known. I'm grasping at anything that can make me feel better but nothing is working. I'm not emotionally well. I just barely left that situation only to be thrown in this one. I'm going from sexually, emotionally and physically abusive parents, who required that I take care of my sibs from age 9 so they could do what they wanted, to being #1 in a baby boy's life.

He's healthy and I should be grateful but all I can think is ""I haven't even had a real chance to emotionally grow up, how can I actually be responsible for someone else, AGAIN?"" And it eats at me. Tears me down on a daily basis.

lostandwanderin,"Lately I’ve been having a really hard time. I’m in therapy but I couldn’t tell you if it’s helping. I am constantly worried, about everything. I go down unnecessary rabbit holes that just spiral me. On top of that my son has developed these little “tremors”. I didn’t think anything of it until I realized what I use to help him sleep .. an iPhone playing a YouTube video of shhhh-ing. I used to put it right next to him. For hours. I did this for months. I did it in the hospital for God sakes the day he was born. 

As I type this I can’t even see through the tears because I feel like my carelessness of microwaving my sons brain could have caused these “tremors”. We have an appointment with the neurologist at the end of the month and I don’t even know how I’m going to manage because I just feel like I ruined him. 

I can’t talk to my husband about it because he just tells me to stop, and that it’s not my fault and that I didn’t cause it. Which is true, this could all be nothing, it could be something genetic (as epilepsy runs in my family) or it could be I microwaved my sons brain.  

I of course moved this iPhone out of his sleeping space and over a foot away, but I just hate myself so much for the potential of what I could have done.

LunaLumen666,"Hello, I'm new here and I need to get a few things off of my chest. 

  My LO is 4 months old. He has had colic since he was 2 months old. I got diagnosed with PPD at his 2 month mark...I was told to take prozac and to get help but with all calls I made no one got back to me. I've called about 6 different people but to no avail. 

  My son is teething now and has colic at the same time, I've yelled at him three times in total which I feel  really bad about because he put his bottom lip put and made the sound he makes when he gets scared. I have now loudly sung his favorite song to yell and he doesn't mind that, I have quite a few disabilities. One is called chiari which I can pass down to him, I have cysts in my spine a pars defect and scoliosis. 

I'm struggling daily, I do all the chores around the house mainly take care of my baby boy. My fiance is really bad with momey and just got paid Thursday and just has 10 dollars left. On top of all of this I don't drive so I never get out of the house and if I do get to go out it's a struggle with my fiance who says every time I want to get out of the house ""Do we have to go to ""xyz"". I just feel like I want to drink myaelf into a coma. I'm sick and tired of this world we live in I feel fucked up for even having a son even though we tried for 2 years.

Why do we do all these things and struggle so much for when it all ends up in nothing. I love my kids but also hate dealing with them. The baby is great but also needy.

My son is 11.5 months, and I was hormonal up and down when he was born, but generally OK.  

When I went back to work in August, everything changed.  He was with a babysitter and miserable, I was miserable being back at work, but then we went virtual and it was almost worse (being home with kid and babysitter) ... I started the testing process in October and got the report a few weeks ago.  

Basically, I do have some ADHD symptoms but trauma from my past and inability to deal with conflict are majorly flaring up and causing a major depressive episode (I’ve had depression and anxiety since 13 so this is not new).  I’m not sure what expectations for myself are realistic right now, I am now going to therapy every week, and I want to explore adhd meds too ... I’m just so sick of feeling like this.

wannabebabymamma,"My LO is 8 days old, and she is wonderful. She's an easy baby so far, and the most adorable little thing. But, motherhood has NOT made me feel how I was expecting. I was so so excited for his stage, and now I'm nothing but emotional, stressed and overwhelmed. 

I cry ALL the time. During the day, I cry because I love her, I cry because I'm worried she isn't eating enough, I cry because she won't move her little hand out of the way while I try to get her to latch. 

But, at night, it's a whole new ballgame. Firstly, I cry every evening around 5pm because its getting dark. I don't know why, but when I see its getting dark, I get very close to having a panic attack. I think it may be because her ""witching hour"" is right around 10-12pm, and the thought of needing her comfort a very awake and tearful baby makes me very anxious. I also get this wave of loneliness that feels different at night. Like that I just wish someone (other than my husband, who is there and who is amazing) could be there to talk with me and help me through. 

Then, after getting over the fact that it's dark, I just cry. No reason. I just cry for an hour or 2 straight. I get frustrated because I can't explain why I'm upset. I was sitting there last night watching Karate Kid, baby fast asleep and I was balling my eyes out. 

I know I'm still very much in the hormonal take over stage of post partum, and that these feelings may fade rather than turning into fill blown PPD, but it's a lot to handle.

So as the title explains, my sister has postpartum depression. She had twins a few months ago and it really messed with her. At first she was willing to seek help and then she suddenly stopped going to therapy and stopped taking her medicine. We have no idea why and her husband is too much of a coward to ask her or push her. I’m concerned about her. She isn’t eating right, tries to sleep in until noon (would probably sleep all day if she could) and lashes out at her family (us) over the smallest things. Our mom has an old way of thinking and just says “oh she’s sick, let’s just give in because it’s easier”. She lashed out at my other sister and I earlier this week and refuses to talk to us. Part of me just wants to apologize but the other part knows what we weren’t wrong in the argument. I have no problem apologizing but what’s to stop her from lashing out at us again and not change her behavior because she thinks we’ll just give in and apologize? Her husband is “more scared of her” then we are (+ he works really long hours at a hospital). 

We don’t know what to do anymore. She’s ruining her relationships and it will affect her ability to be a good mother. We don’t even know how to approach her. We’re really desperate.

coppolaseyes,"This is such a stupid problem, but it's completely overwhelmed me and I can't cope. I've been struggling on and off with my mental health since my DD was born 11 weeks ago. I've been doing okay for 2 weeks nearly, but Christmas has completely set me off. 

We've not been able to see any family since she was born, until Christmas which we spent with the whole family: 3 sets of grandparents, 3 sets of uncles and aunts. At first it was wonderful finally being able to hand her off to people and not having her constantly on my chest, but it got old quite quickly. 

When I'd greet people - my own family - they'd completely ignore me and start cooing at DD. Sometimes they wouldn't even make eye contact and I'd have to raise my voice to even be noticed. Every time she cried I'd be completely on edge. Family would completely ignore my advice on how to soothe her, do everything I'd specifically tell them not to because it was a quick fix, and then they'd get irate when lo and behold she'd start screaming again 5 minutes later from being over-stimulated. Or she'd finally settle with one person, and then be immediately handed off to another person, waking her up and upsetting her. 

In some ways it was comforting feeling my maternal instincts kick in when she cried, and reassuring when I'd take her back and she'd instantly settle in my arms. It made me feel like I wasn't entirely broken, that I was, indeed, mama bear. 

We spent a couple of days with family and came back yesterday. It took 2 cars to bring back all her stuff and presents. It took hours to unpack all of her presents and most of her clothes are still in half-organised piles around the house. I have been completely overwhelmed since. Our actual gift requests have been completely ignored, as usual, and instead grandparents and uncles have bought whatever they want, refusing to talk to each other about what they were getting so we have doubles of everything we don't want, and zero of everything we've asked for.

 This happened a lot, of course, during the pregnancy, but now I'm close to bursting. The selfishness of it has completely knocked me sideways. No one is respecting the kind of parents we are trying to be, no one is respecting my knowledge of my own daughter, no one seems to care that I'm her mother. I'm just the vessel that brought their granddaughter into the world. I talk about the trauma I suffered during the birth with years in my eyes and all they have to say is ""but it's worth it for such a beautiful girl, and you'll forget about it when it comes to having your second one."" No words of comfort, no understanding, no acknowledgment of my pain. It's like my depression isn't real because I'm not real, I'm just necessary attachment that comes with the baby (though seeing as we've had more offers to babysit than invitations to visit as a family, I'm not sure they even see me as a necessary).

It's not that my family don't love me, of course, it's just the way people behave around babies that make mums feel invisible, and make PPD worse. The presents are just a symbol of the mentality of grandparents. And they feel like added pressure. Up until now my daughter has had 1 toy (she's 11 weeks old, it's all she needs!) But now she's got a houseful of them and I feel suddenly or of my depth, like I'm not entertaining her enough, like I have to dress her in these (sometimes hideous) impractical clothes that make for difficult nappy changes and that don't fit over her cloth nappies because they're gifts and everyone wants to know if she's worn any of the 15 outfits they've bought. They think they're showering their granddaughter with affection, but instead they're just weighing their daughter down with pressure and guilt.

BobbysueWho,I reached out to everyone who took my insurance and said they work with postpartum in my area that was on physiology today. Not one response. At my babies last wellness check they had me fill out the questionnaire about how I was doing and then told me it was probably time to seek help. I asked how and they asked if I had a regular doctor I told them no and they said if you did they could probably help you with that. So am I supposed to make an appointment with a regular doctor to ask them to find me a therapist? Or do I make an appointment with an OB and ask them to find me one? My babies check ups ate with a doctor at the family health center. I had been seeing my midwife there before the baby was born and thought that the doctors there were the doctors have seen when I was sick yet no one specifically. I don’t understand why they could not give me a recommendation or some direction. I need a separate appointment to make another appointment?!?

briellapantoja99,"My son is two years old. I myself have PTSD and severe depression that is from a quite terrible childhood. I hate pills I hate medication and all that jazz so I never wanted to quite see a doctor asking if it’s postpartum depression on top of my normal depression I have just for them to tell me to take more pills but at this point I feel I have to. My son compared to “most toddlers” is not bad at all and I should feel absolutely lucky. He sleeps all night ever since he was a baby and he eats good, and doesn’t throw many tantrums like I’ve seen my friends and family’s kids do. 

Anyway, my only source currently as a stay at home mom who’s in school during this pandemic where I can burn that bad energy and anger and annoyance out of me is when I work out. Except, I work out while my son is up now that he’s bigger because I hate working out super late at night and I don’t do mornings. Even now I feel I have zero space for myself. I want to love my son. I want to feel like he’s mine and not someone’s kid who got dumped on me. I read to him, get him everything a child could possibly ask for, but at the end of the day...I just feel a huge hole in my heart ever since he was born? I feel I am not giving him the love and attention he or any child deserves. I have an amazing boyfriend who does so much for me...but I get these episodes where I just don’t want to talk. I lock myself in the bathroom if he’s home and just cry it all out. I’ve stopped trying to keep communication with friends even if they texted me a lot. It’s been months not going out to see them ever since a year has passed having my son. I feel so tired and I just don’t want to put any energy in friendships especially knowing I have been screwed over by more than just one person who I have given my all to when they have nothing because I’m a loving person like that. 

It’s been two years, I would think my postpartum depression would be go away around now but it feels it’s gotten worse. I just want to love my son. I want to stop feeling emotionless. I want to stop having to go in the bathroom every few days crying in place of wanting to kill my self sometimes. It’s just so much. I have no family to turn to even so it’s just my boyfriend who I have any love and affection from during these times. I wish I was me again. At 22 I feel 50. I lack any motivation I had when I didn’t have my son.

And sometimes I feel like screaming at her to shut up and then I break down into sobs about the guilt. I have it really easy I have lots of family who want to help and my fiancé is wonderful but I move around to go north a lot and he works now more than ever so I feel like I never see him and when he does have days off I want him to enjoy them so I don’t like asking him to help more than I already do because he does so much.

I love my baby so much and I want her to be happy but I’m impatient and angry all the time and it’s not fair to her and what if I hurt her or myself. And then I’m fine if I have a nap but I don’t want to nap or I can’t nap and everyone tells me how great it is that I’m doing fine and how lucky I am and what a good baby she is and she’s amazing she really is so I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

I think I want to have PPD or something and I don’t know why because everyone even people who have had PPD tell me I don’t and that I’m doing really well. Am I just desperate for some sort of mental illness to fit in or something that I’m making shit up or that I’m causing my own problems and stress for sympathy or something I don’t know.  I feel so stupid and dramatic and I don’t want to go and ask for help or something only to be told I’m fine and just looking for attention because I don’t even want it so why do I feel like I do?

revolutionutena,"I had my baby a little over six months ago. My husband and I had been on an absolutely nightmarish infertility journey for about 3 years prior to this, and finally being able to have a successful pregnancy felt like a miracle. I do feel like one of the issues was that I got so focused on getting pregnant I lost sight of the ultimate outcome of having a baby. 

I was 28 weeks exactly when the pandemic hit and everything shut down. In some ways this was great as it meant I WFH my entire 3rd trimester with a very slow workload (I'm a therapist at a university - very few students were thinking about telehealth therapy last spring.) All my classes had been canceled including newborn care, tour of the hospital, and breastfeeding. I had no idea how to care for a baby, and my husband is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair so we really needed that tour. 

The birth experience was traumatic - I'll do the shortcut version and say I pushed for 3 hours, they told me a C-Section wasn't possible but were worried he was hung up on my pelvis (he wasn't, he was just enormous - 4th degree tear enormous), and then they gave me a medication post-birth that sent me into a feverish delirium so I missed the first hour of his life. No skin to skin, no first attempt at breastfeeding, no first moments snuggling with him and sweet pictures.  

Then the baby had some medical complications in the hospital (breathing) that they couldn't figure out so he was whisked away all the time for tests. When he was in the room with us, I couldn't get to his little bassinet because of my 4th degree tear and my husband couldn't get to him because of it wasn't accessible from his wheelchair. So we had to listen to him scream until the nurses could come get him and hand him to me - often took several minutes. The LCs who came to visit me ignored all my questions and responded to ""This really hurts"" with ""It shouldn't."" The doctor following up on his medical issues was both condescending and vague, and once they figured out his medical issue (it was minor) and we begged to go home, he essentially questioned whether or not my husband and I could take care of him given his disability. 

I spent the first 2 days still trying to breastfeed and wanting to die - the nurses told me I had to feed him for 30 minutes on each side, then pump for 30 minutes, and by the way he eats every 2 hours. So based on that I would get 30 minutes a cycle of not doing some sort of BFing. I gave up after 2 days which immediately lifted my suicidal ideation but brought on a BUNCH of judgment from 2 of my sisters in law who are massive lactivists and who sent me books about how I was harming my baby by giving formula.

It's basically been a roller coaster ever since. We have no family nearby and very little support from friends or coworkers. We have a nanny for when we work and I thought this would mean I would see the baby a lot but I'm so busy I rarely do - I mainly see him in the evenings when he's cranky. 

On the days I do get more time with him (weekends or right now when our office is closed) I feel overwhelmed and like I have no energy. I wake up in the mornings and just don't want to get up or parent, but I know there's this little life that depends on me and I have to. I feel like I don't engage with him like I should, help him with his milestones, etc. I also feel like he doesn't trust that I will take care of him or help him when he cries because I seem to so rarely be good at soothing him when he does - he's a great little self-soother and honestly it feels like it's because I'm so shit at it he just has to do it himself.

Overall I feel completely underwater, no energy, no enjoyment of parenting, just a horrific sense of dread every morning. And then the guilt because we worked so hard for this baby and now I can't even do what I need to do.

I have a therapist I've been seeing and an appointment to discuss antidepressants in a couple of weeks but everything just feels so bleak and hopeless right now.",Postpartum_Depression,"IF Baby, PPD, and Guilt",https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/kn5p3c/if_baby_ppd_and_guilt/,1609372030.0,2020-12-30 16:47:10,
Comprehensive-Hope13,"well I guess first I should start off with some facts.. I met my boyfriend in April of 2019, I was 17 (about to turn 18) and he was 24. I had previously been in a abusive and controlling relationship before I met him. We worked at the same job and one day he asked for my number. At first it was amazing I felt like I was finally getting what I deserved out of life like the stars were all aligning. A few months in around July , we began to get in small arguments and in my eyes it looked like another failed relationship headed down the drain. There were sexual complications as-well, only having sex if it was initiated by me. I guess because of the slight age barrier he must have felt uncomfortable coming on to me.

 

I felt very undesired and when I spoke on it the issues weren’t fixed and it really sucked because I really thought this was gonna be my shot at genuine healthy love. I made the choose of meeting up with the ex I previously mentioned and having sex with him. I guess I felt like if I wasn’t going to be happy with anybody else I might as-well run back to what in some ways felt “safe”, disappointment is always easier when it’s what you expected.. right? Non the less I felt ashamed and regrets it immediately, I made the decision to tell my boyfriend what happened right away.

 

I realized I wanted to make it work with him but knew I couldn’t go our whole relationship holding on to lies. I wanted him to know what happened and have the decision to stay or go, I felt he deserved that. We decided to try to make it work and I spent the next few months trying to do all I could to make it right and never did it again. I feel like it’s important to included that around this same time he was kicked out by his stepfather and mother because they’re house didn’t have the space for him and left with no options but to live in his car till he found a place. I was doing all I could for him.

 

Making sure he ate , washing his clothes at my house , keeping his clothes at my house , sneaking him in my parents house some nights just to have a warm bed , making sure he had a place to shower and brush his teeth everyday. Anything I could do to improve his quality of life while he was stuck in this horrible situation. I would have gave him everything I had if it meant seeing him sleeping in his own bed again but unfortunately neither of us had the money to get our own place yet. While this was all going on we found out I was pregnant with his child in October 2019. It was a very stressful pregnancy, I had HG for those of you who don’t know what that is, it’s a illness some pregnant women develop which leads to severe morning sickness I could barely eat without throwing up and ended up in the hospital a hand full of times.

 

Even water would make me puke so you can imagine how stressed I was. He tried to be there for me the best he could. In December 2019 we finally had moved into our own little apartment. This is when it really got bad. Lots of steaming and fighting. I was very stressed and very hormonal from the pregnancy and developed a habit of wanting everything to be clean and spotless I would nag about him not cleaning up and it would often lead to fights.

 

I was very irritable and easy to set off. He began to drink very heavily , picking me up from work some nights completely drunk and treating me very rude after I finished 12 hour shifts while pregnant. I believe this is when his cheating started. He was texting women receiving naked pictures from them and touching himself to them. Talking to them about me. Just emotionally and sexual entertaining them. Lots of them. Some even being exs, although most were randoms. I don’t know if he ever met up with or had sex with any of them because I was never able to get it out of him but he swears he couldn’t bring himself to take it that far.

 

I caught him in a few lies over the months but was to oblivious to really see the bigger picture. This continued on for most of my pregnancy and even continued after I gave birth to our daughter in May 2020. I’d say around September 2020 is when many of the real truths came out and I started to learn what was happening behind my back while I was pregnant.  I was so angry I was so upset. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t have decency to just tell me how he felt and what was going on especially after I had the respect to tell him what I did in the beginning of our relationship. Why did I not receive the same?

 

I was there for him at his lowest point while he was living in his car but he wasn’t there at my most vulnerable part of mine during my horrible pregnancy ? we have been trying to make it work for a few months now but I feel like such a shell of a person I’m constantly have flashback of what he did. I’m constantly thinking of all the times I thought everything was fine and this was all going on without my knowledge. Im constantly paranoid it will happen again. I feel like I’m constantly looking all around me. I want to just erase this whole chapter of my life but I can’t because my daughter is the physical embodiment of what happened to me , a percent scar and reminder of the horrible time in my life.

 

I love her to death but sometimes I still look at her and feel the need to run away from her and him. I feel angry that I kept her. But I don’t want to. He’s tried to make it up , words gifts actions sex. You name it. And he really has turned out to be an amazing father I love the way he loves that little girl. But I still feel no better. Or I’ll feel better for a day or two maybe even a week then it’s like it all starts over again. I have nightmares and flashbacks. I’ve gained so much weight from the pregnancy and stress and don’t even care to work on my self because I feel worthless.

 

I feel like no matter what I’ll never be the girl he wants or the mother my daughter needs. I feel trapped. I can’t stop comparing myself to these women he was talking to I can’t stop asking all the what ifs. I feel so unsure of my future and feel like I would rather die than continue. But I couldn’t do that because more than anything I don’t want my daughter to have the traumatic childhood that I had.

I dont feel much of anything these days. My toddler would be screMing her head of and i just stare emotionless like im watchong paint dry on a wall. She would throw a tantrum and i would just pretend she is not there. She would be playing outside and i would not care...i feel like something is wrong but i just feel so hollow i can't  get the strength to get up and act like a mom. I just feel like im a failure, a nobody, i dont enjoy anything anymore, my existance is meaningless. I cant talk to anyone, they all have their own problems. How do i get help with no money? I can barely look at my daughter with a smile, farless be a parent. I actually fantasize about her going away forever or never being born. I dont want this, ANY of this.

It might just be the post partum talking haha....

The father is there, i love him and he helps me alot, but sometimes i wish i broke up with him and/or we never met. Then we would not have a child that i have to take care of with post partum, ontop of my already depressive disorder that i had before being a mom....

So now i have two depressive disorders, post partum  and whatever depression i had since the age of thirteen. Been suicidal since the age of thirteen too. Im rambling i know. But, ive been having a suicidal episode from since last week, and its just not going away. I dont care about anything except dying right now, motherhood feels like a ball and chain.

I couldn't bring myself to bathe, and now i have to take care of a human that depends on me. I have to distract myself or else i might like the idea of killing myself too much.

Its my mental disorders talking....i just want to vent all the poison and toxic thoughts so i can keep the suicidal thoughts and voices in my head at bay a little longer. The father and i dont live together, i live with my parents btw.

I can't stand the idea of gaining all this weight again for this pregnancy and struggle to get it off again!  I was 5 freaking pounds away from my pre pregnancy weight when I got a positive test. I am crushed..    I know I am going to love this baby, I am just struggling with it all.

DragonAtlas,"The standard cry. She'll look at me and had lips will turn downwards and her eyes will fill with tears. Then the first little cry cough turns into a low crescendoing wail. All the while, I know what is happening, I know what is coming, but I can't do anything about it, no matter what I try. She stares me in the eye as it grows and I'm am powerless.

Then comes the choked cry. The one where she is upset enough that she doesn't have enough time to clear her through properly or take a real breath between wails. The gurgle that comes out instead increases the intensity a thousand times and it rattles around my head like a pinball. Every breath is a high score.

The tiny dejected sobs. The ones that shake her entire body but the volume has decreased. I know I've failed her, and she has given up. There is no getting better, and I'm just there, useless, and she is alone. 

The cry of varying pitch. She will be normal crying and then a burst of energy makes me aware that she thinks I haven't noticed. It's tinged with anger and there is no reasoning with her. I want to tell back but what good would that do? I just have to accept my fate as an evil presence in her life. 

This quickly becomes the voice break cry. When the pitch suddenly turns into a banshee squeal, because her voice has broken and is so sore. It sounds like she is being tortured. I am the source of the torture. Nothing I can do will convince her otherwise.

The disappointment cry. The one where something dangerous is taken away from her. The one full of betrayal and the begining of hate. The one where she communicates best not all. This time, it IS my fault, 100%, and she wants me to know it. Her lips turn blue as she refuses to take a breath between sobs. It's just a silent gagging, to punish me. Eventually she takes a deep breath, and releases an explosion. I deserve it.

The cry of fear. She wakes up, safe and cozy in her crib, warm and loved, but she wasn't expecting it. The sheer terror in her voice cuts me so deeply. I didn't mean it, I just needed to get some sleep too. Please, forgive me.

Crazystaffylady,"I have two daughters, one who is 22 months and one who is 7 months. I had a miscarriage in between the two girls.

I had PPD after my first which was bad, it subsided quickly when I was pregnant with my now second baby. (The PPD was still severe when I was pregnant with the baby that I lost but I got pregnant with baby two very soon after I miscarried and everything subsided).

The PPD came back with a vengeance when I was 28 weeks pregnant. The last trimester was really hard and I kept experiencing repeat occurrences of reduced movement. It made me hate baby2. Everything started to sour and I felt relieved when she was out. My first night in hospital with her was awful, which just strengthened my bad feeling towards her. She was born during the first lockdown in the UK which didn’t help things.

So I’ve been having IPT therapy which helped, going through the circle of security with my mental health nurse and taking sertraline. I’m in a much better place than I was but my relationship with baby2 is so up and down with her. 

She’s just being a normal baby but I find her so difficult and I hate myself for thinking so negatively of her. 

I don’t feel like it’s ever going to get better. It’s been 7 months already and I know she deserves better as well.

Confident-Lynx8404,"Hi all, I just recently stumbled upon this page as I’m desperately trying to help my wife. So I hope that I’m not doing anything against the rules of this sub by not being the mom. But I need some advice or help or something. 

My wife and I just had a baby about two weeks ago. Since then my wife has been almost unable to sleep. She said she feels like she can’t breathe and her body jerks awake as soon as she falls asleep. She suffers panic attacks periodically that have gotten to the point where they’re debilitating. It’s gotten so bad lately that it’s almost like she can’t function normally. 

She’s talked with her OB who put her on meds, which she’s just started taking. We’re hoping those kick in and help so we can put this all behind us.

I guess the reason I’m posting is because as a husband I’m totally lost in what to do. I do as much as I can around the house and with the baby so she doesn’t have to. I try to be supportive as possible. I make her get out of the house, go for drives, walks around our neighborhood. But even after all that, she still ends up crying and unable to sleep. I feel helpless. Idk what there is that I can do to make things better, if anything at all, but any advice is welcome. 

Also, what advice or encouragement would you give to her? That I can relay to try and help?

She wasn’t hungry. She wasn’t wet. She’s wasn’t too hot or too cold.  Her dad had her while I hid in the room with our door closed. But I could still hear her crying through our thin walls. I wrote my suicide letter. And then I thought about my babies, my fiancé, my family. Then i burnt that letter and finally told my fiancé that im struggling and have been struggling for a while. I told him how I feel as though I don’t love my daughter as much as my older daughter and how I wish she wasn’t born. He admitted that he felt the same way but doesn’t wish that she wasn’t born.

mike7792,"I am experiencing the baby blues/ post partum depression/ anxiety. 
Our son is 3 weeks old. He was a late preemie (35 weeks). I don’t feel any bond with him. He was delivered via emergency c section and spent a week in the NICU. 

From the moment he came home with us the anxiety hit. It’s a combination of so many different feelings such as, this is so difficult, regretting we ever had him, constantly fearful that my wife will burn out which would mean I’m screwed, or he has a difficult feeding and took 2 hours to finally go back to sleep. I’ve never been a very patient person and over think things and let things build up in my head so I’m certain it doesn’t help.

The pediatrician suspects our son has “grunting baby syndrome” where he is learning to pass gas or poop sleeping/laying down. 
This has actually been one of the most difficult things to deal with for me. 
So he is constantly kicking, grunting and screaming which often leads to him waking himself. I’ve been dreading putting him to sleep because the grunting syndrome has happened as soon as i lay him down or shortly after and then he’ll wake again after trying so hard to soothe and rock him to sleep. 2 hours later of unsuccessfully trying to put him to sleep and it’s now feeding time again. 

I’m literally living my life one feeding at a time. I constantly have this weight on my chest and feel quite down everyday. Spoken to my family doctor and a counsellor.

I try to bond with my baby, I try to rub my stomach and talk to her. I try to make myself get excited. At first I was buying her lots of cute clothes and other items but I’ve slowed down. I’m honestly just really really really depressed, I’m in a shitty abusive relationship and have a shitty home life and have no clue where’s a safe place I can to live after the baby’s born, so I know that’s most of the reason why I’m so apathetic about motherhood. There are times when she kicks and it honestly just makes me more depressed or makes me feel... almost annoyed? I’m really sad because I wish I was getting loving feelings and enjoying every minute of this pregnancy. I really mostly only talk to her when I cry and I apologize for the way she has to hear me cry. I’m due in 11 weeks. I have daily thoughts of giving the baby up for adoption. I feel like she deserves a mom who is excited about her, not one who cries for hours every day and night and can’t even provide her with a stable home. I have literally no family who is supportive. I haven’t had a single dream about her my entire pregnancy, and last night I finally had one. She was about 7 years old in the dream. The sad part is, when I woke up I wasn’t even happy, the whole idea of motherhood freaks me out and I just keep having this feeling that I’m not going to enjoy it and I don’t want to do it and I physically can’t do it. I didn’t have a good childhood. I fear I will give her a bad one because I don’t know how to be a “good” mom. This isn’t how I wanted to become a mother. I didn’t want to do this alone and I didn’t want to live in fear that my baby father would kill me one day. I’m just honestly wondering if it would be best for the baby to go to an adoptive family? I’ve had mental health issues all my life and I’m really reliant on marijuana and alcohol, obviously I’ve had to stop since being pregnancy, which is also part of why I’m so so so so depressed.

After baby came I stopped therapy just due to not having time and I was in a really good place. I was the happiest I have ever been when I was pregnant and that was despite the complications we had. I felt amazing. Since giving birth it’s been a slow slide back into depression. It’s worst right before my period, I feel numb and catatonic.

My husband has been home with me the whole time and its been amazing. Our little guy is only really happy when he's being held, if we put him down 3/4 of the time he cries. My husband gladly holds him so i can shower, cook, clean, poop...

He left the house today for 3 hours to go prep his equipment for work. The baby started to cry when he left, and cried on and off the entire time he was gone. I tried everything I know to soothe him, and he still cried. 

This stint my husband is going to be gone away to work camp for 5 days. The next stint will be 2 months. After just three hours today I feel so fucking worthless as a mother. I dont know how to help him and i get so frustrated after awhile and then I feel like shit for being frustrated. I feed him, change him, burp him, rock him, feed him gripe water, work his legs.

coppolaseyes,"My LO is 9 weeks old. I love her, of course I do, she's my world. But sometimes I regret the decision to become a mum. I don't know if I can cope with it. When she's awake, she can be awake for maybe half an hour max before she starts crying. I feel like I spend my days in fear waiting for her to wake up and cry. I feel like we have so little happy interaction time. My husband is always cooing with her and talking with her, and I'm just constantly afraid of talking to her and even looking her directly in the eye in case she starts crying. I have this fear that she hates me and every day I wish that I had been the one with the higher paying job so my husband could have taken the parental leave and I could have gone to work because. 

I went through a lot of trauma with the birth and I think I've kind of just pushed it to the back of my mind because my brain can't handle that AND the trauma of parenting. I dread nights. I dread days alone. I dread my husband coming home from work knowing I've done so little in the day - even though he doesn't care what gets done in the house - and knowing that the evening grizzles are going to start. 

I've not phoned my GP to book my postnatal examination yet because I don't know if I want to talk about this to the GP or not. It's not that I don't want to get help, it's just that I've sought mental health support before and I know what's on offer and, quite frankly, it's not worth the hassle. I stopped taking my anxiety medication days after she was born because it makes me drowsy and if I'm not able to sleep through the night I'm a zombie in the day. If o talk to my GP they will just put me on antidepressants (like I have the time to deal with the drowsiness and side effects I've had with them in the past?) Or they'll tell me to refer myself for therapy, which requires me finding a time when LO is calm enough for me to call, and waiting up to 6 months just to receive 6 sessions of therapy. What's the point? We can't afford to go private, and even if we could, everything's over the phone. I can't talk about this stuff over the phone while I'm home alone trying to care for my baby. 

Everything feels so hopeless. It's been a rough couple of nights, so I'm hoping I'm just tired and I'll feel better in a few days.

I also had to finish an online class so that made it worse. Some days I would go into auto-pilot mode and be super cold with baby. Some days I was a little rough handed and I remember a few times I screamed in front of him from frustration :( In the first month, I pumped most of the time because I had issues breastfeeding. I remember one time he vomited because I was scarfing down the bottle so much, just out of fear that he was hungry. I cleaned him up and I just cried so much after that. 6 months later I have flashbacks of this time and feel so much guilt. Like, why wasn’t I more patient and gentle? It wasn’t his fault that he was having a hard time eating. It’s not his fault he has to eat every hour. It’s not his fault that the only way he can communicate is by crying.

BobbysueWho,"
My birth was traumatic for me I know a lot of other people have probably had it harder but for me it was not at all what I expected or hopes for. Then every mom I know want to know how my birth was. Like it is a magical tale to share. Which made me feel so ashamed that it wasn’t that way for me. After 3 days in the hospital I felt like I gave up and just did what they told me. Luckily I did because after 6 hours of being fully dilated she still would not drop. Her heart rate started to flutter when I would push and I knew That though I am deathly afraid of surgery I wanted my baby out healthy and safe. Turns out she had a very short umbilical cord. No amount of pushing and waiting was going to do shit for either of us. I completely disassociate during the c-section or at least I tried to the best I could while the cut me open to rip my baby out of my body. Then shoving my guts back in and gluing me up. The process of getting her out was so fast it was like nothing after holding her it was like non of it was really happening to me then she and my partner left leaving mr on the table without them while they put me all back together. I have know idea how long it took but it was an eternity. It didn’t hurt but I could definitely feel it all. 

My partner is wonderful but he is gone foe 12 hours a day on average he gets home on either the 5:30 or the 6:15 boat. We make because he works in public he then takes a shower. By the time the boat docks he drives home and bathes we have usually lost another hour then I am trying to put the baby down by 9. Which is really me nursing her till after midnight while she sleeps for a few minutes here and there. So we generally see papa for 2:30 to 3 hours before bed. Most of that time is spent eating dinner and arguing about chores (I argue he looks sad and tries to do as much as he can tired and sad.) he has ADHD so he often runs around trying his hardest and accomplish very little but frustrating me. I wish it didn’t because I love him so much and I know he’s trying. 

I’m not diagnosed with postpartum and at first I was so distracted by everything it was all so overwhelming and at once I felt numb. Now that my partner is back at work and I have so much time to think I just feel like it is pilling on top of me. I am getting manic trying to keep the house clean while I also feel chained to the couch. I’m so mad at my partner that nothing gets done but he does so much and I feel so worthless. I know the baby needs and loves me but keeping her alive is all I can manage to do and sometimes I feel like I’m not doing a good enough job at that. She is fed and her but changed but to I read to her enough, teach, play, tummy time!! Help her to do the next big step. Am I even  a good mom? Is it normal to constantly worry your baby is going to die? I check her breathing all the time when she’s asleep when does that wear off? At some point I will feel confident my baby is going to survive and grown to be an adult right? Every stage of pregnancy was like this. Just get past this hurdle and I’ll be able to be confident the baby is going to make it to birth. Just make it past this month and the baby will make to a year..? Is that normal?

I found this sweet and at the same time got sad. I didn't have this feeling of being so in love with my baby until he was already a year old. I loved him but I wasn't in love, I wasn't crazy about him and I didn't feel so incredibly happy that he was finally here.

probably-complaining,"I’m a FTM to an 8 week old boy. 
A little back story - I had a sorta tough last 8 weeks of my pregnancy, got induced at 39 weeks, had a 29 hour labor with 2.5 hours of pushing, got an infection that caused constant vomiting and a fever of 101, and after all of that, it ended in an unplanned c-section. Before my c-section, my epidural stopping working fully. So during my c-section, I could feel it all. After about 5 minutes, they decided to put me under, which meant I missed my son’s first breath, made my boyfriend miss his first breath, missed the skin to skin, missed so much. 
The first week or two, I felt very guilty and was down on myself quite a bit. But I was also extremely sleep deprived. I was better for about 2 weeks before everything went to crap. I cry probably 4 hours out of the day, there are days I feel like I should just give my bf full custody because I just feel like I’m not a good enough mom, I’m not sleeping much and only eating about 1 meal a day.

victoria-lisbeth,"Buckle up buttercup, we're going for a ride. 

After nearly five months I want to share something. And I want to share why I think some women don't end up sharing.

My son is a light in my life. I love him. I love his eyes, hair and nose. His crooked grin in infectious. I would die and kill for this child. And sometimes I just want to leave him in his crib and walk away. Then I want to break down into a panic attack because he'd be out of my sight for longer than a second.

Post partum depression and anxiety are fickle bitches that way. 

PPD isn't just sadness and blues. Sometimes its anger or apathy. Sometimes its a revolving door of everything at once. When he was born, I didn't feel he was my son. I didn't instantly connect like you hear about. For the first month it was just an autopilot of trying to make sure he stayed alive and Jesus Christ in heaven who let me leave with him?? I was riddled with the worst anxiety I've ever had. I couldn't sleep because I was panicked he would stop 
breathing. I kept on hand near him in his bassinet in case he rolled over. I silently cried at night when I tried to breastfeed him and couldn't. 

It got better. It got worse. It eventually has settled into a kind of middle ground truce. I'm majority anxious and it flips between everything else.

Thoughts are like a bullet train in my head, while my body feels like its moving through molasses in winter. And cue the anxiety because if I'm moving along that slow then how can I gettohimintimeifsomethinghappensohgodohgodohgod

Now for why its so hard to talk about.

How can you talk about it? How do you say I sometimes (lots of times, more times than I want to acknowledge) I hate being a mom. I sometimes hate my kid. Sometimes I want to just leave. Not even pack up, just go. No I'm not going to get cigarettes, I'm gone. Most times I want to scream and cry that I don't want to do this anymore don't make me. Or just cry. 

Then go from that to sleeping on the nursery floor because now the baby is in his crib and I'm terrified, petrified about to full on panic about it because he's in his crib. Panic attacks over not seeing him for a minute. Leaving him with someone, even though I know for a FACT he's in good hands. 

And you know how people are going to react/what they'll say. Well you wanted kids. Do you know how many people want kids and can't have them? Do you know what people would give to have their kid back and you're talking about just leaving? 

You know a bit how those moms who abandon their babies think. You have an inkling about their thought process, because you've had it. 

Bottom line here. Sometimes I feel/think I'm a horrible human mother wife. Even five months in. I won't feel this way forever (God I hope please). I may not feel this way tomorrow.

I make sure when I am home I feed the baby, I am up with the baby all night (when it is feeding time).  I am am looking for some advice in regards to anything else I can do to help.  I am thinking about having my wife talk to her OB or someone and see if there is something else we can do.  I love her and don't want to see her like this.

taylornoel217,"I had my first baby June 2019. I only recently came to terms with the fact that I had a serious case of PPD. After my husband went back to work. I was so depressed, crying all day, yelling at my kid. I was exhausted, depressed, and lonely. 
My SIL told me about me about takingcarababies.com. I sleep trained my baby and he started sleeping through the night at five months. I seriously can’t express how amazing her program is. Her Instagram constantly has success stories. (I was just reading through the posts and saw that a lot of people were struggling with baby sleep, and despite what I’ve gone through I can confidently say her program works). Even with my baby sleeping well I still struggled.
Fast forward and COVID happened and my husband started working from home, and his job is mostly waiting so he was able to help a lot with the kid. I got pregnant again and I just felt super guilty all the time that I felt like I couldn’t handle one kid by myself. I literally was terrified of having two babies because I couldn’t handle one. I felt like a terrible mom. I feel like everyone has it together and I was literally falling apart every day several times a day.
Now I have a two month old baby and my husband is home on paternity leave and now I don’t feel like I have PPD but postpartum rage. I have so much anger, and I’m scared of the effects it will have on my oldest. 
My doctor prescribed me anti depressants but I just found out my dad has a chronic depression problem and has been on anti depressants for over twenty years. I’m terrified to take them for two reasons: to become dependent on them and to not feel like myself on them. 
My husband is such a big supporter of me through this. I only told him recently about my experience with our first kid. I love him and he just wants to help get through this. He’s been encouraging me to talk to someone about my experience and I’m just looking for someone who can relate to what I’m going through.

Grimmshadow88,"He is a saint. He’s literally keeping me sane while I battle PPD. In reality, our kid is pretty good, but the small struggles we have are mountains for me. I’ve suffered depression for years before due to an untreated thyroid condition. (Under control now) Regardless, here I am with PPD anyway. I was dreading it because I had this feeling it would happen. It hit me so hard. My son has never been a good breastfeeder and it’s literally kills me that I’m not able to feed him properly. That was my first source of stress that triggered it. I started self harming. I had suicidal thoughts daily. (I sometimes still do, however fleeting) I fantasized about jumping into the ocean and just telling myself they would be better off without me. Now he’s hitting his 4 month sleep regression and I’m literally paralyzed in fear and anxiety putting him down for naps and bedtime. On top of that he’s a crappy napper, 25-30min at a time and then he’s up again. I literally never have time to catch my breath. 

Enter my husband. My beautiful, amazing, loving saint of a partner. He’s been there to hold me as I cry and have panic attacks over breastfeeding. He’s basically taken full charge of every nap and bedtime. All so I can hold on to my sanity long enough to pull out of this. When I told him I was harming myself and that I was thinking about taking my life, he just full stop took over. He knew something was wrong and he’s doing everything in his power to give me some peace. He’s working full time and I go back in January. He’s literally pulling me through this. I love him so much. I knew I would love him forever and that our love would grow but not like this. I don’t even have words for how much l love him anymore. It’s that exponential. 

We are working to find a therapist but it’s been challenging. I love my son. I want him and I want him to be happy. I want to be happy making him happy. I feel like such a failure because everyone always makes it seem like having a kid is one of the best things that can happen in your life, yet my depression is lurking in my mind saying “you’ve made a mistake”. I know I didn’t, and I wish that thought would just kindly fuck off out of my brain forever.",Postpartum_Depression,Without my husband I don’t think I would be here.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/k8x92e/without_my_husband_i_dont_think_i_would_be_here/,1607426288.0,2020-12-08 04:18:08,
hheather87,"My son is 4 months old. He has four sisters and a brother (3 of his sisters are my stepdaughters, we're a blended fam). 

I have worked as a freelance copywriter from home for almost 7 years. I also homeschool 4 of the kids. Before the baby, I had days where I could go tan, get my nails done, take a joy ride, etc. to enjoy some time to myself, but now, I don't get that. 

My husband does a lot. He works and helps here, but he has a lack of patience and honestly I'm better at taking care of the house and the baby and the schooling. I don't want to complain about him, but we had 2 disagreements this weekend that I'm going to share.

The first: Friday evening, he comes home from work and sits down to watch TV. He takes the baby so I could get some work done. He then gets one of his daughters to take the baby. He goes to sit on the toilet, decides to take a bath, whatever. Baby starts to fuss so yeah, I get him and all my stuff and go to our room. Hubby asks what's wrong, I tell him if I came to his work and brought the baby for him to take care of, he'd understand. Cue WW3. It got heated fast, and sadly one of my main points was that I wanted to finish work as quickly as I could to spend time with him. I even sat by him while I was working and I told him I was trying to spend time with him.

Second: Last night, he loaned a friend one of his trucks for the week. Our water here is messed up from maintenance on the water lines, so I'm using bottled water for bottles. There was a case of water in the truck he loaned out. He goes to his other truck and brings back 3 opened bottles of water. I told him I won't use that for the baby as it carries the risk of an infection. Major attitude, but he went and got more water. I told him I'd take care of it, but he left without a word. Yay. The friend? Yeah, my husband spent the last 3 hours helping him. That's all fine and dandy, but I'd expect someone who can spend 3 hours on some BS (and it was some BS) to help his wife with something pretty simple without being a man baby about it. 

I'm a bit of a wreck at the moment. Zero down time. The house is a mess. You can't get real help around here. I'm considering staying with my sister for a while. I know how this sounds, but 50/50 sounds great right now. Do I really want that? No. I really just want a little help and understanding, some time alone and a date with my husband. I have had some thoughts I'm not proud of over the weekend.

ell_cee,"I have been struggling since my baby was born three weeks ago. I've been crying every day, and feeling either sad, anxious or numb and not much else. After a lot of urging from my husband, I called a PND help line and they suggested I go see my GP, who prescribed Zoloft and gave me a referral to a psychitrist who I think I will be waiting a while to see, but its still progress. 

The thing is, I have so much support around me - my husband has been great, although now that he's gone back to work he's not around during the day which is hard. My mum is around the corner and here most days that my husband isn't. I have several friends with young kids and babies who I can ask for help and advice. The birth was a bit traumatic, ending in an emergency caesarian after being induced as he wasn't growing properly in the last few weeks of my pregnancy, but my baby is healthy now and overall going well. 

So I feel like a fraud. I shouldn't be anxious and depressed with all this help and support - so many new parents make do with a lot less. I feel like I'm ruining this precious time with the baby for myself and my husband, which makes me feel guilty as well.

Madhamsterz,"Hello Everyone,

I am trying to see if I have postpartum depression or something else. I posted a little ago. At first I had baby blues and cried massive amounts, but now I can't cry or feel most emotions, just dread.. like a hollow empty tree. Its too mentally exhausting to take care of baby and I could sleep maybe 20 hours a day. 

My baby is 5 weeks.

But I got covid at 2 weeks and believe it has damaged my brain. I don't know what to do. Has anyone else felt that existing from one moment to the next was pure torture?

I feel like someone else.. not who I used to be.

bre_ann_a,"I (25 f) and my partner (40 m) have a two and a half month old daughter. She is our second child. Our first child died in my arms in the hospital at only 4 weeks old. I will admit, we rushed into having a second child because we were devastated when we lost our first. We would sit together while I was pregnant and imagine all of the wonderful things we would get to experience being both first time parents, and then he was taken from us as quickly as he was given to us. 

After he died, I became pregnant 6 weeks later. My second pregnancy was misery. I was already depressed and deeply mourning my son. I took antidepressants to help. Then came the sciatica. I couldn't move, sleep, BREATHE without pain. Life was horrible. I had a c-section this time for health reasons and the recovery was equally as horrible. 

Not only was my recovery horrible, my daughter was too. She cries and cries and cries. We don't know why either. We've taken her to the pediatrician sooo many times and he prescribed a few different formulas including soy formula, formula for colic, formula broken down to the smallest proteins, tried gas drops, gripe water, apple juice, Karo, NOTHING HELPS. The pediatrician told us that we're just going to have to endure it until she outgrows it. 

I'm not going to lie to you all, or myself. I can't handle my daughter. A lot of the time I just cry. I hate this so much. All she does is cry. My partner works full time and I dont. I wasn't working during my pregnancy because I quit after my son died because I was so depressed, then came Covid, and then I was in too much pain to work. After I had her, I actually got a part time job just to get time away from my daughter. I quit it because it was actually overwhelming me to do both, and now I am starting a full time job so my partner can't make me feel like I should be the only one to handle her as well as cook, clean, do laundry, etc. 

I know how horrible it sounds, but I am at my limit. I love her but she stresses me out so much that sometimes I wish I never had her at all.

avocado198831,"New to the group! 

I gave birth to the most beautiful boy 7 months ago, I'm a first time mum. My pregnancy went well, I was low risk, and for the first time in ages I felt super relaxed, chilled, despite experiencing severe bleeding in the first trimester which thankfully wasn't anything to worry about, but stressful enough at the time. I felt like I did everything to be ready for the birth: prenatal yoga, NCT support group, hypnobirthing course, read lots, watched lost of videos, etc. I felt slightly petrified, but I felt ready. I'm usually a NIGHTMARE when it comes to health stuff as I have a history of health anxiety, but for some reason I felt the best I've ever been for years during the pregnancy. I just felt like things would be okay regardless of what happens. Then covid hit, thankfully my job enabled me to work from home from mid March onwards. Despite my health anxiety and the unknown about pregnancy and covid at the time, I remained calm (I was a teacher and so is my boyfriend so super high risk!), I dealt with it pretty well. I live abroad so my family had initially planned to come and rent a flat for a few weeks before/after the birth to help me. Obviously that didn't happen, I slowly came to the realisation that I would not have my mummy with me during what could be the worst pain of my life, but again, I was OK with it. Then my pet became severely ill and I was told a few days before the birth he would die shortly. I dealt with it. I was told my partner could only join me during active labour. It was shitty, but I thought I'd be OK. I had entire confidence in the medical staff to make sure this baby would be OK, and so would I. I felt confident.

So obviously I had to be the one with a shit birth. I laboured at home for three days, with quite severe pain during the night which would then go in the morning (typical). I was told I was in latent labour and to only come in to hospital when my contractions would be every 3 minutes, which is what I did. I had to spend the first five hours by myself in a room with no pain relief and to make it until 5/6cm by myself, as there was an emergency and they had to deal with this. I was left entirely by myself for an hour in a room when I was told it would take 5 minutes, in absolute agony, the worse pain of my life. I remember looking at the clock feeling like I was going to die and to just count every second. Finally I was told I could get an epidural and my boyfriend was allowed to join me, at 5am. The epidural obviously took 3 or 4 tries to work (I had a HUGE phobia of being paralised from it), but then it worked, I was chilled, I was fine, I was excited. I phoned my mum to let her know the baby would be any minute now, that I was fully dilated and ready to push, that baby was doing well and coping with the contractions, etc. The next time my mum heard from me, it was 9 hours later.

&amp;#x200B;

The baby sadly got distressed during the pushing phase. All I was told at the time is that his heart rate was dropping, but the midwife looked super calm and chilled so I wasn't worried. Then she told me a doctor would have to come in and check, the next minute I was told they would perform an episiotomy and use forceps, which I was fine with. They all looked so relaxed that I did not have a clue that potentially something bad was happening. The baby was born, I was told he was a boy, that he was absolutely fine, then all I remember is asking every second if my placenta was out yet lol. The placenta did come out, but I was told 'you have a severe tear, we need to take you to theatre'. Again, I thought 'well everyone pretty much tears, it will be OK'. 

So off we went to theatre with my partner and my baby as I was being stitched up for FOUR HOURS. It turned out I had a very , very rare internal tear which required multiple specialists to intervene. I was throwing up non stop from the drugs, was not looking at the baby at all, all I kept asking was if I was going to die. I didn't which is nice :)

The next few hours are a blur, my partner wasn't allowed to stay more than a few hours because of covid restrictions, so off I started being a new mum feeling super fucked up, not being able to walk because of the spinal, throwing up because I didn't have any food for 24 hours at this stage, with a brand new baby. I spent the next 48 hours like this and was told I had a 4th degree tear, that it was very very rare, and that I could develop a super rare complication but that they thought it would be fine as my surgery went so well. My partner had to whatsapp video call me during this time to be able to see his son. My mum had spent 9 hours wondering if I was OK stuck to her phone. I was genuinely, one of the worse times of my entire life. I just wanted to be home, fixed, starting my postpartum time with all the lovely products I had bought smelling of lavender and looking cute in my postpartum pyjams. 

Well guess who had the motherfucker super rare 0.1% of al deliveries it only happens in Africa complication !? Discovered 5 days post birth, an hour after the consultant at the hospital told me I was cleared and it healed up well. Hahahaha. I won't go into details about what my condition is as it genuinely is too gross and would be too traumatising for you guys to read.

Long story short, I was booked in for a stoma surgery 7 days post birth (so back to hospital  
), and was told an hour before getting that they made a mistake and I didn't need one. So I took my suitcase I had packed for a week worth of hospital stay, my brand new baby I was desperately trying to breastfeed, and off I went home, with a super rare, gross, painful condition that nobody seemed to know about. Thankfully I found a Facebook support group of women who have the same thing and that has been the only thing that kept me going and gave me hope that one day, I'll be fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember tears on the bathroom floor the first few days back at home, thinking this was my new normal. I could not walk properly, I didn't manage to sit down for 2 months, my boyfriend had to help me shower. My milk took 12 days to come in, I lost 15 kilos in 7 days, I managed to breastfeed but only lying down for two months.  I was, genuinely , completely fucked, but I was also the happiest mother on earth. I kept staring at my baby and thinking this was genuinely the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

I had dark thoughts one or two days, I'd say maybe 10 days post birth, where I was learning to deal with my condition, and where I remember thinking that my boyfriend and baby deserved and needed a partner and mum in good health and that I was too broken physically to be OK for them. I can't seem to remember directly thinking of taking my own life, but I remember being convinced that my life would be like this forever and that it was my new normal and that I could never ever function again. The thoughts passed quickly, I recognised they weren't healthy, I spoke to my therapist.

I was told at the hospital I would probably develop some sort of PTSD or post natal depression looking at the horrendous complications I suffered from. I was ready to face this.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole summer passed and no signs of PTSD , sadness, etc. I finally got to go home and see my family and I felt like I was dealing with my new condition better and better. I booked a surgery to get it fixed (in January), so I knew my life would get better and that I just had to deal with this in the meantime, I LOVED LOVED LOVED being a mum. I absolutely adored my baby, in fact I wasn't really able to leave it to anyone, even my mum, even for a couple of hours as I loved to be with him so much. My relationship was doing great, I was feeling chilled and relaxed, and I was amazed that my usual anxious personality was doing OK after all this. Everyone was telling me how proud they were of me after everything I had been through during a freakin pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Theeeeen...the cancer saga started. #cancergate. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started one afternoon. My partner had gone cycling for 4 days, and I was looking after the baby by myself for the very first time, I was absolutely petrified, but determined to make this a successful experience. I remember coming back from a walk in the park a beautiful sunny day. I listened to a podcast about miscarriage. It suddenly reminded me of my first trimester and how worried I was the bleeding would lead to miscarriage. For some reason, I felt completely triggered and my mood went from ' I feel so happy right now, I'm looking after my baby by myself and it's going great ' to 'I feel very very anxious and maybe I'm going to die and I won't see him growing up and he needs me to be healthy and OK'. Then this is when it all started. 

I stared at my breasts as I was boobfeeding and I thought my right breast looked odd. Breast cancer crossed my mind. I thought about it quite a bit for a few days, then brushed it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I saw this mole that I could not remember seeing before. I was genuinely convinced it was brand new, started to worry, then found some old pictures of me and saw it was there before. Relief, Phew.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I started experiencing extreme , easy tiredness during the day when my boyfriend came back to work. This corresponds to the moment my little one hit a 9 week old sleep regression of waking up 5/6 times a night, intense breastfeeding, etc, so I didn't worry too much. 

Then I felt like I started putting on weight, felt frequent urination, got tested negative for a UTI. Ovarian cancer was the first thing that lingered a bit too long for my liking. I was convinced my belly fat was ascites, and I remember not being able to fall asleep at night , googling and researching about ovarian cancer. I was fairly convinced there was at least a cyst and that it explained why I had such irregular periods before we conceived. I voiced all my concerns to my doctor, who offered to do the blood test to detect ovarian cancer, By the time it was time to do the blood test, all my symptoms had gone and I managed to rationalise and thought I did not suffer from ovarian cancer.

I stopped breastfeeding, little one started sleeping through the night, but the tiredness remained. One day, I noticed this HUGE purple bruise out of nowhere on my leg. Leukemia. Leukemiagate started, and this one remained on my mind until I had my blood work done, which came back completely normal but B12 deficient. I saw my therapist this day, who told me she was worried I did not look as relieved as I should be. I thought I was just tired and needed time to process and convince my brain I would be OK.

I started noticing that I was hungry every 2/3 hours, and that I actually felt like this for quite a while, blaming on on breastfeeding and sleep deprivation. I first thought it might be B12 deficiency, but I was told by my son's GP it was probably due to acidity in my stomach. He prescribed me omeprazole, told me there was probably not something to worry about, that maybe if it remained we'd check for an ulcer. Then obviously I went home convinced it was stomach cancer I ignored for months.

I could keep going, but today I am now convinced it is something to do with my bowels. I got over the stomach fear, my constant hunger has mysteriously disappeared- if anything, I actually don't even feel hungry. So I came from feeling constantly hungry for 3 months until three days ago, to now feeling like I'm not hungry at all. If I eat food, then I feel like it's nice and I devour the pizza.

I feel like my hunger is all over the place. So is my sleep- I wake up from a solid 8 hour night of sleep and I still feel sleepy for hours. But then in the evening I feel totally fine.

Obviously, everything points towards some sort of mental health / trauma thing. But I'm still convinced my mental health is fine, and that it's a health issue I am dealing with as I'm writing this very post.

michness,"I'm nearly 4 weeks postpartum. I upped my medication so I'm not nearly as anxious but I still feel like I'm bombing motherhood.

I'm worried I don't do enough skin to skin beyond breastfeeding. But she takes 45 minutes to eat and then usually passes out. We put her up in her crib in an attempt to build good sleep habits but I see pics of other moms snuggling during naps and wonder if I should do that.

I'm worried she doesn't sleep enough. She sometimes wakes up three times during her naps and is a pain to get down.

I'm worried I'm failing at breastfeeding. I have low supply so I sometimes have to supplement and I use a nipple shield because it hurt too much without one. I feel like I can't even feed her properly.

I just don't enjoy motherhood like I thought I would. I hate feeling this way. When she was born I wasn't filled with immediate unconditional love.

Everyday feels so repetitive. I feel like I never get time for myself or my husband and I miss our old lives.

neverbewhitout,"Why is it so damn hard to get help for PPD/PPA? 

I finally accepted the fact I most likely have it, as it took awhile to realize. I bit the bullet, and started calling referrals for therapists. All waiting lists. I specifically said I’m suffering from PPD, which I thought would be pretty important, but now I’m just sitting and waiting. I also made an appointment with my general physician since he’s always been supportive and he may have an idea for possible medication - have to wait 2 weeks for the earliest possible appointment. Even the therapists that I’ve been put on a waiting list for don’t take insurance. Oh cool, now I’ll have to pay $100+ each appointment, out of pocket? That won’t add to my depression whatsoever! 

Just when I finally became brave and honest with myself, it’s all a waiting game. I want help NOW. I’ve been struggling for 8 weeks, and while I should have reached out earlier, I wasn’t ready to admit it to myself at that point. I don’t know. This just sucks all around. 

And you know, it makes me feel awful for moms that are struggling a lot worse than I am. Are they having to wait this long? Or longer?! It’s not right or moral. I know it may be horrible to say, but then people sit and wonder why moms abandon their child, or worse.

Madhamsterz,"Hello everyone,

Bear with me I am using text to speech while pumping. I suddenly am aware that my mental health is really struggling. I was diagnosed as positive with coronavirus on Monday. It is assumed that both my baby and my partner had it as well. It was extremely stressful and led to a lot of sleep deprivation and stress around-the-clock. I am now on data and and I think physically I have come through the hardest part however mentally I am taking a dive.

In addition my baby has had issues with feeding and nursing the whole time. 1st the issue was that she fell asleep all the time period she was born at 37 weeks induced because I had high blood pressure. Later her issue was that she spit up everything said to her and I didn't quite yet know how to burp or sufficiently in wasn't using a proper bottle. But now the issue is that she will not directly breastfeed or if she does for not very long and she only wants to be bottle-fed. I find pumping exhausting and that I'm always running out of milk almost which is scary. Having coronavirus also made my milk stores go way down which was very scary. Trying to avoid going to formula to really stick it out with the breastfeeding. 

I find a feeling of anxiety when my partner tells me hes going to go to bed at night. I also feel anxiety when he leaves the house. Is no longer contagious and went to visit a friend who lost a family member.It just makes me anxious to be alone right now.

I speak sweetly to my baby and I try to stay calm but my emotions are really all over the place. Rationally I know that things can be temporary and that this is due to hormones and maybe illness but it is just a really sick feeling that is hard to just talk myself through like I usually can.

Being pregnant was one of the happiest times of my life. I generally struggle with anxiety and I found myself so happy and almost high the entire time... this concerned me because I know crashes come after highs.  I feel that crash right now.

Really stunk that I couldn't invite anyone over while I was sick to help me. Stinks that I can't go anywhere in this pandemic. I feel like I am in an alternate reality. The sleep deprivation is definitely a challenge even though my partner takes in the morning so I can sleep. 

I do see a therapist once a week already so I will talk to her about it but I feel like I need more than that .. what are the treatments? Do people go on drugs? 

Depression and anxiety run in my family and my father definitely has bipolar problems. For some reason I saw I might be spared but this is proving to be a challenge. 

I just want to know that it's temporary. 

Can anyone help?",Postpartum_Depression,Coronavirus Positive with 3 week old triggering major anxiety and depression.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/k30gxj/coronavirus_positive_with_3_week_old_triggering/,1606639399.0,2020-11-29 01:43:19,
missJMAR,"This is unbearable. And it’s a constant roller coaster of emotions. One minute I think I’ve accepted it, then I’m on the floor crying the next. 

I’ve suffered from Anxiety, Depression, and Panic Disorder since I was about 15 years old, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II about 3 years ago. Pre-pregnancy I was on four medications, and when I got pregnant, I cut it down to three because one of them wasn’t safe for the baby. It took me 6 years of actively seeking help with 5 different doctors to get my medicine combination just right. And it finally happened RIGHT BEFORE I got pregnant. I was on cloud nine and felt normal and like myself again for the first time in over a decade. Then.. I got pregnant. 

In 2016, we decided that we really wanted to start a family. I had an IUD, which I removed so that we could get pregnant. We tried for over a year also with no luck. Then we just stopped trying. This time around, I got off my birth control because my fiancé REALLY wanted to try (I didn’t.. I would get such bad anxiety every time after).. and of course, it only took ONE TIME. I think that’s one of the biggest factors. I didn’t want to get pregnant this time. I didn’t want a baby. I didn’t want my life to change or to make room for anyone else. But, I went with it because again, he wanted it, and I wanted my baby to know my parents, and I wanted my parents to enjoy my baby while they were still young. I thought it would all be okay by the time I delivered. 

Now, the exact thing I feared would happen did.. I’m mourning my former life.. which I loved and was so happy with. I feel trapped and the anxiety of it is like none I’ve ever known. It’s a constant feeling of deep, all encompassing terror. My stomach constantly aches, my head hurts, I’m numb, I haven’t eaten more than a few spoonfuls of food in the last couple of days, I haven’t showered or gotten up from my spot on the sofa other than to make formula, change a diaper, or if I have enough energy, to go to the bathroom. All I seem to do is sit staring off into space or just lay down and sleep.. I feel like my brain just shuts down so I don’t have to face the reality of any of this, which is so out of character for me. I’ve always been one to face things head on and confront any issues or difficult situations.

There’s no going back. There’s no amount of time that will pass that will undo this. It’s permanent. And I don’t know if that’s what scares me, or the fact that I’m still not ready to be a mom.. if that’s even what I want to begin with. It’s not about not having time for myself to do the things I want to do. I know I can ask people to watch her so that I can have time to myself.. but at the end of the day, she’s here. Forever. She exists. There’s no going back to just me by myself or just me and my parents or just me and my fiancé. I truly and wholeheartedly enjoyed it when it was just the four of us. I finally found the place in my life that I was in love with and could enjoy with a sane mind. Now, no matter how much time I spend away, she’s still there and I have to return to that life. There’s no more JUST ME time.

People that feel this way say that it has nothing to do with their baby, and sometimes I question the truth.. every time I look at her, I feel unconditional and pure love.. but I can’t help but also feel fear, despair, pain, sorrow, and sadness. I just find myself constantly returning to my past life in my mind and resenting this new one that was supposed to be rainbows and fairy dust and instant love, bonding, and connection with your new role as a mother and your baby. There’s even moments when I feel almost jealous of her.. that she has taken center stage in my life. But I don’t mean that in the way it sounds. I’m by no means being ignored or neglected by my parents or my fiancé. It just makes me all the more confused and frustrated. I have no idea what is going on in my head nor do I understand my feelings. 

I have an app that keeps track of the baby’s age, and when the last time they were fed, had their diaper changed, how long they’ve been sleeping, etc, and seeing the “11 days”.... I immediately think to myself... “it’s only been 11 days?!! Oh wait.. There’s only the REST OF MY LIFE left of this.” It feels like a life sentence in prison. Which is unbelievable to think that that thought is actually crossing my mind. Who thinks like that?? I hate myself. 

I had a really rough birth (but that’s another story) and I thought that the moment I heard her cry, everything I had feared and all the anguish I felt would disappear... it did not. Everything felt even more magnified. There was no excitement, no relief, nothing. Just fear. When I was in recovery and got to spend time with her, I felt a slight shift. I was happy and really excited to start my next chapter outside of the hospital with her. It’s only been 11 days,  but it’s been some ups, but mostly downs. 

Yesterday, I hit rock bottom. I fed and changed her diaper while my fiancé finally caught up on some sleep (he’s pulled literal all nighters since we’ve been home from the hospital to make this all easier on me).. and I looked at her and just cried and screamed internally.. asking why I allowed myself to get into this situation knowing I wasn’t ready yet. All I’ve been doing is crying and pleading as silently I can.. I really don’t know how I’m going to get past this... the deep waves of anguish and regret. And when I feel something in my gut... let’s just say I’ve learned not to go against it. And this time I did. I knew I shouldn’t have become a mother yet. I thought now would be the right time because of covid and being forced to stay home and because I’m 33 and time is running out. I thought 10 months would be enough time to get excited and feel ready for motherhood. It was not. 

Another reason I’m so devastated is because me and my fiancé have never been closer.. we have had a VERY rough relationship. A lot of it one sided at one time or another. But now, I’ve never felt so in love with him and all I want to do is spend all of my time with him and ONLY him. I want us to have all of our time to ourselves. It’s all because of how amazing he was with me in the hospital and what an amazing dad he already is and how he’s been taking care of me and our daughter... it’s a side of him I never knew existed. And I’m so sad that 8 1/2 years got away from us that should have been like this.

I just don’t know that this is really what I want.. and it’s too late to go back. It makes me physically sick. I love my daughter and I don’t don’t want to feel like I regret her or for her to ever know that I felt this way.. I’m just so mad at myself because I knew I didn’t want this yet and I went with it anyway.. because I’m a people pleaser... I’m always trying to make everyone else around me happy.. and now I’m stuck in this prison in my mind... and this poor little girl has to be involved in it. 

I really pray that I will get past this.. or I have no idea what will happen to me. I truly fear for my sanity and my future happiness/contentment. I’ve read about a lot of women who still regret becoming a mom and it’s been years. I’ve seen my friends with their children and I always thought to myself “thank god that’s not me” and how glad I was that I was ending and beginning each day the way I wanted to with the people I wanted to. The idea of motherhood never appealed to me. I always said “one day when I have kids..” but never REALLY thought it would ever happen.. and now here I am.

My cousin told me that in 3 months I’ll feel better. But 3 months feels like an eternity.. and that’s just the beginning. I just want to stop feeling this way. I want to turn back the clock and undo everything until I know that I’m ready. It’s beginning to affect everyone in my household. I can see that I’m hurting my parents and that my fiancé is doing EVERYTHING he can to hold it down for me and keep me strong. But eventually, it will take its toll on him too.. and I know I would FULLY lose it then if I let him down. I hate myself and my mind for feeling this way. And like I said.. there’s no undoing it, there’s no amount of time that will pass that will fix this “situation”... I can only sit in fear and confusion.. and it really scares me. 

I’m also concerned because this isn’t an easy fix like a physical ailment.. as I mentioned earlier, it took me 6 years to find the right combination of medications to feel better. And then I got pregnant. Now I have to start all over and there’s a new life involved. I’ve never been more afraid for my sanity than I am now. 

We had my fiancé’s parents over for thanksgiving, and at the end of the evening, it was my parents, his parents, baby, myself, and my fiancé, and I felt a little better. I don’t know if it’s the isolation of the pandemic that makes it a little more difficult, or what, but sitting in the house alone all day while the other people are catching up on sleep definitely doesn’t help. Even watching TV shows and movies, and listening to music that always made me feel better doesn’t help.. they’re actually triggers reminding me of my old life. 

Please don’t misunderstand me and think I hate my child... because that’s not it at all. My dad told me I’m not in this alone.. there’s three other people in this house that are here to help me.. but there could be 1000 and I’d still feel this way. I’m trying to think of another time I felt so trapped and scared... but I can’t for the life of me. And even if there was another time I felt this way... there was always a way out, a light at the end of the tunnel.

saltyhotwing,"(Baby is 7 weeks. On mobile and pasted from OneNote so sorry for formatting)

So I actually expected that I would get PPD when I was pregnant - I have a long history with depression, and PPD runs in the family, so I correctly anticipated that I would also experience it. What I didn’t anticipate is the guilt that I feel for being depressed. There are so many posts about PPD where the OP gets no breaks, no rest, no time away from baby, but I do. My husband is awesome. We take shifts at night, so I get a 5 hour stretch to myself (whether or not I sleep is a different story, but I do try). Plus I usually get a couple hours here and there during the day to take care of myself and do things I enjoy. Baby eats pumped milk and formula, and I’m weaning off of pumping because every time I have a let down I want to smash everything in sight and tear my skin off. So baby doesn’t count on me nursing to eat, meaning husband can fully care for him without me. Husband is a true partner and I’m so lucky to have him. 

Not to mention that I’m back to working from home while husband is off work for another 6 weeks (he gets a full 12 weeks paid parental leave while I got 6 weeks of short term disability at 60% pay for 4 of those weeks). I have the best job and the best boss ever - my hours are nearly 100% flexible, and my boss outright told me that I get to bill full time but I’m not going to have much on my plate so I can focus on baby and not be overwhelmed. I literally could not think of a better situation work-wise and husband-wise. 

But it’s like no matter how much time away from the baby I get, I’m always craving more, and I feel awful for it. I know that I love him because the thought of something happening to him is a horror I can barely contemplate. But where is this weird overwhelming love everyone talks about? I half expected fairy dust to swirl around me when I locked eyes with him for the first time. Right now I’m so unmotivated to do anything with him that sometimes I can barely look at him, let alone talk to him. It breaks my heart because he doesn’t deserve this. It’s not his fault, but he’s the one who’s going to suffer. He’s the one who’s going to have stunted development because I can’t bond with him. He’s the one who’s going to have a limited vocabulary because I can’t think of what to say to him and hardly talk to him. Eventually he’s going to be old enough to notice that sometimes Mom looks at him with dead eyes and a blank face and he won’t understand that it’s not his fault. 

 Thank god his dad is around because he at least gets one parent that he likes. Dad can soothe him and put him to bed with little issue, but he’s basically non stop fussy with me. Everyone warned me that he may not like his dad in the early months - not one person said he may not like me. 

I certainly can’t blame him. I feel like he’s going to grow up and resent me for having him when I so clearly wasn’t emotionally strong enough to handle having a child. What the hell was I thinking? This is exactly why I waited years to have a baby - I knew I wouldn’t be able to handle it. How did I forget that? 

And now I can’t take it back and there’s no good solution. Can’t end it because then he grows up without a mom and that sucks. Cant run away for the same reason, and also makes me the worlds biggest douche. So, what? He grows up with an emotionally unavailable mom? One who loves on him until he starts screaming and then breaks down almost immediately? I want so much for him to feel able to be open and honest with his feelings as he grows up, but how on earth is that gonna happen if I lose it every time he cries? At least when he finally cuts me out of his life for being a crap mom, we’ll both get some sleep, I guess. 

(FYI I have spoken to my OB about depression and she put me on a medication I used to be on, along with the two I was already taking. I have a list of therapists in my inbox that I need time and motivation to call.)",Postpartum_Depression,Why did I do this lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/k2mliz/why_did_i_do_this_lol/,1606590382.0,2020-11-28 12:06:22,
beelove414,"Hello all, 

I am looking for some advice about my husband. A little backstory we have a 15-month-old daughter that was conceived via IVF. Also my father-in-law passed away this past February. We have both been out with Covid for the last three weeks and today was my first day back at work, I work 12 hour shifts so when I am gone, I am gone the entire day. 

When I came home today I could tell that my husband was not himself and not in a good mood and after pressing him, he expressed that he feels very depressed because he does not enjoy being a parent and he feels like he is a prisoner in the house and can’t go out and do anything with her due to covid and The fact that it’s just a hassle to leave the house. He also told me that he was frustrated that she did not eat well today and was throwing food (which she does all the time.) He said he feels like a failure as a parent because she’s never happy when he is taking care of her and only happy when I am home with her (not true). After speaking about this for a little while, he said that he is feeling very depressed because this was the first major holiday without his father and we did not get to spend it with the rest of his family due to us having Covid. I tried to get it out of him if he is just feeling depressed about his father or truly does not enjoy being a parent and he said he feels both. He also said that he can’t wait for 7 PM every day because he knows she will be going to sleep soon and he won’t have to worry about being a parent...

We have both felt that becoming a parent was not exactly what we envisioned but we are still enjoying our daughter. I asked him if he wanted to speak with someone and he said no. He said “I will get it together “   

Does anyone have any advice? I would like to help him because I have definitely had days where I feel this way but it’s not every day that I am waiting for bedtime and cannot wait for a break from her.  We love our daughter and worked so hard for her, it is breaking my heart that he is feeling this way.",Postpartum_Depression,Depressed husband.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/k2gpmd/depressed_husband/,1606561262.0,2020-11-28 04:01:02,

mmehukattii,"Idk if this is right place... i (20) was in hospital for a week after my water broke and my daughter was born 5 days later premature and she spent a month in nicu. it was extremely hard time. she has been at home for a month now and im so proud of her, shes growing well and is very lovely. But what makes that hard is that im married but i feel like i am a single mother taking care of her alone. it started already when she was in nicu. i spent my days there, i went early in morning and came back late in evening. he (26) visited there only few times and when he came he stayed like an hour. now that shes at home, im the only one taking care of her. he has fed her only 4 TIMES. he has never changed her diaper or gave her bath. i wake up at night to feed her. all he does is sometimes cuddle her amd other times he play playstation or spends out with friends (he literally disappears for hours) i try ask him if he could for example feed her once at night so i get few more hours more sleep, i think its reasonable since im the only one taking care of her and he stays up until morning anyway. but he always makes some reason why he cant. sometimes its 'im afraid' sometimes 'im tired' or whatever... one day i asked again if he could feed her at night once and he said no, this time reason was that its my job as a mom. we had a huge fight, first i tried say nicely about how i feel but he didnt react well. Also he had promised to me when we were trying to get pregnant that when baby comes he will help as much as he can. LIES.
theres literally days when hes at home with us and i ask if he could be with baby while i take shower. immediately he has something 'more important' to do. i have said its fine if he go oyt sometimes but he should also spend time with us, he said he doesnt want to be in prison.. funny how he gets all the free time but i cant even take a 10 minute shower alone or eat my food without holding baby. he is totally capable to do it too. he keeps telling me i need to be with baby all the time and care about her, he can clean home and cook. AGAIN LIES. i do it all with one hand while holding a crying baby with another. If i dont clean, our home looks like a fucking mess and he gets so angry. Im so fucking tired. I love him a lot but i feel like either he wasnt really ready for having kid or he regrets it. i have had moments when i think it would be better if i was alone. i have had moments when i start cry out of nowhere because im tired and frustrated. i have noticed i have started to think and say stuff like 'i wish i was dead so i could rest."" I wish i could have a fucking break. Even if it was only goinnto grocery store alone or takinf a bath. Im so anxious and frustrated i cry a lot...

I was so excited to get the extra time with my daughter. I love being around her but it’s getting to be so draining. I want to leave her to stay at my boyfriends any chance I can get. That sounds incredibly selfish and heartless but it’s so nice to have the break. It’s usually only one night every other weekend so nothing crazy but then the guilt eats me up everytime I do leave.

BalboBibbins,"My kid#2 is 3 months old. I've been experiencing really overwhelming moments of anger. It's not brought on by any specific big thing, just seems to be a culmination of a ton of little (some not so little) things. I got sick this weekend, missed an event, broken down car, etc. I broke the door today because it was stuck and I was baby wearing and couldn't really fuss with it, so I just kicked it.  

I had PPD/PPA with my first, heavy on the A. I'm wondering if what I'm experiencing now could be the same bird with new feathers. I didn't have anger like this though. My main worry is to not be an a-hole to my first child. She's 4, and definitely triggering lately. She keeps asking for things, every minute, and cops a major attitude about everything. Can't blame her though, I couldn't open the door and broke it! 

I'm definitely feeling overwhelmed, unsupported, isolated. With the pandemic, I have my kids 24/7. Definitely eating some garbage and not getting enough exercise. The ground is fertile for some issues. 

Anybody else experience this, or even super different symptoms of PPD after multiple pregnancies?

I need to figure out some coping strategies. I'd like to avoid therapy, which helped a lot last time. But I'm not really feeling the anxiety this time so I want to try to get on top of the rage before I go the therapy route.",Postpartum_Depression,Rage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/k0jlgy/rage/,1606297622.0,2020-11-25 02:47:02,
emu222,"For back ground I have suffered from mental health in the past (depression, anxiety, panic disorder and PTSD) so I’m no stranger to the feeling of not feeling yourself. My OB and Midwife were great at making sure everything was going okay, and everything was during the pregnancy, and even the first couple months PP. 

LO is almost 5 months old, and I love them to absolute pieces, I really do, I am happy to be a mom. On the other hand they just started teething, so naps have basically been non existent. We co-sleep (don’t come for me, it has worked amazingly up until the teething) and now he’s waking up every 2 hours super fussy! On top of all this DH and I don’t have any family in the province we live in. With all the restrictions in place I barely get out of the house as it is, but now no social gatherings at all, so I’m even more isolated. The more I’m stuck at home alone with this crying baby the more and more I start to resent the LO. I hear them cry and just look with absolute disgust, and let them cry a bit before snapping back to and going to care of them. 

On top of all that I then have so much guilt running through my mind about that and other things, that when I go to reach out to family or friends my guilt tells me not to because they will think I’m a terrible mom. I know that’s not true, but that little voice is currently stronger than my voice of reason.

Katiebabes,"It's weird ya know. I ended up have kids 7 years apart. And with my first child I knew. Like. I really knew I had post partum depression. Hell was so bad her father cheated on me repeatedly because I wasn't me anymore. When she was 18 we found out I was pregnant again. But with complications and I lost that little baby at 7 and a half weeks.
 We separated when she was two when I finally had enough of the lies and the cheating. And I fell in love with an old friend from highschool. The 3rd year into our relationship. We found out there was only a 3% chance that I'd ever conceive without help. 
Two years later I had a miscarriage again at 12 and a half weeks. But that same year we were blessed to find out for Christmas I was pregnant again. And he immediately jumped into working so much harder picking up another job just so I didn't need to return to work right away knowing I was high risk. He did everything he could to make enough money for us. That baby is now almost a year and a half. And I still to this day don't feel like myself. 
I've..I've burned bridges on friendships for no reason. I've shut myself in. I never leave my house unless I have to go to the grocery store or go to work. I have ironically made friends on the internet that I talk to sometimes. But I don't have anyone anymore. And I feel like my now husband feels the way my ex did. That I'm not me anymore.

The delivery went well, fast, really fast actually, no complications, healthy bouncing girl with a set of lungs on her lol my sister has another baby that is 17 months.  She was already worried she wasn't going to be able to love both babies. Everything was fine at first and then sweet baby girl has been crying every 5  to 10 minutes for the past like 7 hours. We've tried everything, she seems to do good when I'm holding her and rocking her which I don't mind at all and when she is actually nursing. My sister broke down a few hours ago saying she just wants to go home and be with her son. I also get that, she's never been apart from him. She wouldn't let me help her after a bit and just kinda was trying to do the cry it out method which is normally very anti with her son. I don't have kids, so I can't really say what my stance is. Sweet baby girl was having a crying spell again and she just sat in the bed staring at the wall crying. So I grabbed baby girl and rocked her back to sleep. Once she was asleep, I asked my sister if she was okay. I wanted her to be open so I told her whatever she is feeling doesn't make her any less of a mom. Because it doesn't. She's been through a lot and he ready has some anxiety and depression issues and I need her to be okay. She told me she doesn't want to do this. I wanted to make sure I understood and I asked if it was sweet baby girl and she cried and said yes. I'm worried about her.

sadmom90,"I have a 13 month old and just when I think my mental health couldn’t get worse... it does. 

I have tried for over a year now to get help and I just get doors shut in my face because of doctors being unwilling to prescribe meds without an evaluation by a psychiatrist, but then getting (multiple) referrals and having each one say that they won’t treat breastfeeding mothers and it just feels like a slap in the face. My partner keeps telling me to seek help and I’ve tried and I honestly don’t think I can handle getting turned down again. I just can’t cope with that, I’m already beyond hopeless.

My baby doesn’t sleep, he’s hard to put down. He wants to nurse and then rock and rock and rock. I hate it, but also I hate sleep training even more and we tried it anyways only to have baby throw up from crying and he never ever lays down. He just keeps crying until eventually I nurse and rock and plead him to sleep. I asked my partner to take the lead on sleep training again recently, sent him the stuff and yet he never follows through. We all need sleep and at this point I’m so stressed about going back to work (as a nanny) and having my kid never sleep. I won’t have the time to spend 40+ minutes putting him down for a nap with another baby to take care of and I can’t neglect my duties to take care of my son like I can at home. I feel like it’s going to be an absolute shit show, yet everytime I tell my partner how stressed I am about going back to work, I’m met with just a “you can do it, you’ll be great.” And it’s just not what I need to hear.

It’s like that with everything too. I feel like he doesn’t even try to sympathize or make my life easier. I only ask of him to clean the kitchen at the end of the day and deal with garbage and recycling and put away the folded laundry. I do all the cooking and housework besides that. And it gets done maybe 50% of the time and it’s never actually clean. I still have to sweep and wipe down the counters and put away clutter. Am I really asking that much?? I’m sick of it and it makes me so angry that I see red. And I’m tired of being so angry. 

Back to my son not sleeping- my partner is so hard to wake up at night that when I ask for help after being up for hours with the baby, it can take him 10 minutes to wake up after having to shake him awake. And then he takes his sweet time to help and I’m literally in tears by the end of it. I want more than 2-3 hours of sleep and for him to not guilt trip me when I ask him to help at night. Last night I was at my breaking point when after I asked him to help, he brought the baby to nurse in bed and the baby kept pinching my nipples and I yelled at it. And I cried. And my partner just sat there saying nothing and not helping. I deal with the baby all day, and fight for it to sleep and nurse it all day, and at constantly being touched. I just want space at night at least and I don’t even get that.

I grabbed my keys and left at 1am but I didn’t know where to go so I just came back home, but I really just want to leave for good. I’m so fucking tired. I’m so angry. I’m so hopeless. And I just have to keep going with no help? I can’t see a way out or an end in sight unless I just kill myself. I want to die so badly. At the same time I don’t but I don’t see a way out. How am I supposed to go to work in two weeks when I’m barely making it through the day with one baby. And then I’ll come home to my own messy house and have to clean that by myself before bed and then still not get a break when my baby needs me all night.

beawax,"I don’t know if it’s PPD or if it’s just me but does anyone else ever feel like their best years are behind them? 

From age 17-22 I was in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic asshole. Because of this I spent my years cooped up in a tiny bedroom, and never really ventured farther from that. Sure he would take me to bars but I never got the thrill of flirting with random strangers or being hit on(until I turned 22 I was overweight, I spent that whole year losing over 100lbs). He never made me feel special, pretty, or wanted. The whole relationship he belittled me, compared me to other women, and generally just put me down for whatever reason he could find. 

I finally smartened up and got out... I got my first well paying job(well enough that I could leave and survive on my own) but I immediately met the love of my life. I don’t regret this. He’s an absolute dream and no matter how down I get I will never ever regret meeting him. But, not even a year into our relationship I got pregnant. We were both thrilled and 9 months later we had our beautiful son. But now at 24 I feel... full of regret? I don’t know how to look forward to my future. I suppose because I don’t know what I’m looking forward to? I feel that my most attractive years are behind me(society says this is age 18-21), I didn’t go to college, I didn’t travel, I didn’t make any memories. I guess I turned out to be the thing I feared the most- completely unspectacular and incredibly average. I now have a saggy mom bod, and even *if* I can lose my pregnancy weight gained I still won’t feel attractive... I’ll still be saggy and approaching my 30’s, which as we all know as women is when society starts to view us as trolls (please note when I was 18 all I looked forward to was being 30 and successful so I definitely don’t share this sentiment lol). I won’t have a career. I won’t be able to travel because my job now is to be a mom. Unfortunately I’m disabled so I always had two choices- pursue a life of fun and whimsy or be a mom. In the moment I chose to be a mom and I love my son, but I can’t help feeling sad about the loss of the potential of my old life? I don’t know how to explain it. I wish I hadn’t wasted my young years with an abusive asshole who tore me down and kept me at home. I wish I’d gone out, flirted around, slept around, felt what it feels like to be wanted by someone. I wish I’d made cool stories and memories. I don’t have anything exciting to tell my son about me. My parents used to tell me about all the cool things they did before I was born. I don’t know. I guess I just wish I could tell 17 year old me not to go anywhere near that guy. I wish I’d told myself to go out on adventures, see the world, make friends, make memories, explore hobbies, interests and passions, flirt around, sleep around, whatever.... instead I spent it sad, abused, and lonely, in a tiny bedroom with nothing to look forward to except one day finding the courage to leave and start my life. Now my most attractive years are behind me. My best years are behind me. My chance of having a fun and wild youth is gone. Sure I could do these things 20 years from now but... does anyone have experience with this? Is it just as fun? Every 40 year old woman I’ve met just complains about how old they feel and look and make comments about how all I have to look forward to is incontinence, a husband that won’t touch them or spend time with them anymore, kids that don’t call, and honestly they just sound miserable as all hell.

Tonight I figured out she just might want an extra few ounces of milk, that's what babies do, but I just started getting angry and I got angry at myself for getting angry with the baby. She was already fussing and I was trying to burp her and calm her down at the same time and after I paid attention to her scream near the end I think I realized maybe I hit her back a bit too hard for the burp.

I dialed it back and fed her more instead, that calmed her down, and then I continued the burping and she's fine but I cried.

S0lac3_of_the_m1nD,"Mental health is declining

I have a beautiful 15 month old son. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
I had to quit my job due to the whole COVID mess, in order to provide full time care for my son, as we lost the care we had. I have to give the highest respect to stay at home parents. 

My days consist of doing all the cleaning, all the cooking, raising my son, teaching him. There is nothing else...my fiancé works full time, partially at home. I have never felt so alone in my entire life. I never  go out because of COVID. Never. Whenever i talk to my fiancé about needing to go out, to have a break by myself (to see one friend, masked, with social distance), he always brings up the what if’s, and how it is a risk and our son could get sick. So I stay, out of fear that what IF my son gets sick? He and I both would blame me. 

I think that I may have some form of depression. I feel like I’m just surviving. Just trying to get through each day, raising my son the best i can. I feel like there is just zero romance from my fiancé. I am very affectionate, I remind him often how much I love him, what i love about him, how handsome he is etc etc. but i get nothing. Once in a great while he calls me pretty. I’ve asked him if he could plan something romantic for us, and he always forgets. I asked for the 4th time this past two months and he said he needed help thinking of something... 
i also don’t feel appreciated. More often he has comments about when I have a hard day with my son and I’m so exhausted by the end of it I just say that my son has been a tiny bit of a butthole. The more recent comment being “I wonder where he gets that from”. 

I have no job. I have no money. I have no insurance. I want to try therapy but there is just no way without insurance or income. I can’t even know if I do have depression , and if so, what can be done... all I do is live for my son. 

I’ve still not lost the remaining baby weight and i just hate my body. I just want to feel loved and beautiful and appreciated. My fiancé likes plenty of pictures of other women that are sexy but where are my compliments or anything at all?

I don’t know what posting this will do.. it just felt good to finally say (or write) this out loud.

I don’t really have any other family and neither does my husband. We are both trapped at home, working remotely. I am thankful that we have our jobs, but it is incredibly isolating and stressful. My husband’s job doesn’t care that I work or that we need to take turns dealing with the baby (now 9 months) during the day. He’s up until 3-4 AM every day trying to catch up on work. I have selfishly been putting my work first because every time I receive an email, it triggers me and sends me into an angry spiral. Baby can’t be put down for more than 5 minutes without crying. I’m at the point where I just put her into her crib to let her cry because her crying triggers me and I have shit to do. We don’t have any help or support system. I have a younger sister, but she works and also does not feel comfortable watching children. My husband is on his final warning and is expected to be seated at his computer for his entire 8.5 hour long shift. They are now monitoring his computer to ensure this is taken place.

I’ve been planning for an abortion all this time but have no courage to do it. Now I’ve decided to have it. When I found out I was pregnant I was not excited. It didn’t click to my mind that I was pregnant. I only knew I was too busy to think of having another one and on the side I was gradually falling into deeper PPD. Now in my PPD and fighting first trimester, I’m all over the board. I’ve cried because ive let things go and fall behind. All I feel is as long as the kids are fed and safe then they are fine.. so I go back and lay in bed. In my ppd misery. My husband supports me and understands I am struggling but he disagrees with a lot of the things I am mentally thinking. He does not think I should be making decisions right now based by my mentality and emotions. I can agree with him that I’ve let myself go and I am not thinking correctly. I felt like I don’t want to fight anymore, something fight for myself and my kids. I just want to feel better already and be happy with my kids and family.

shelbylou939217,"I feel like my PPD has ruined my relationship with my baby (3 w, 5 d old). 

It's especially obvious since my mom came to help us out. With her or my husband, he's very calm and content. He was awake and chilling with my mom this morning and when I tried to hold him, he instantly started fussing and crying. My mom tells me to not get ""frustrated"" and ""stay calm"" since he can pick up on that but it's not exactly like I can turn my emotions off. 

And I'm not frustrated. I'm heartbroken that my baby doesn't like or love me. He smiled a real smile at my mom first. And smiles at her a lot. He barely smiles for me. I feel guilty for not being able to turn off my emotions or switch them to more positive ones when I hold him or interact with him because I feel like if I could do that, we'd be able to bond and he'd love me. 

When I come into the room and say something my mom and husband will be like, ""Oh look, he's looking for his mommy!"" Which I just feel is bullshit they say to try to make me feel better and encourage me to come hold him. 

I feel like it's all my fault. I've had PPD pretty much since we came home from the hospital and I'm sure that's affected our ability to bond with each other. And I misread his signals a lot so he gets really upset while I try to figure out what he needs/wants. 

And then when my mom came, I was so desperate to get some sleep and to get a break, I let her take over A LOT of the baby care I normally do during the day. So, I got what I wanted I guess. He wants nothing to do with me now. 

I just don't know what to do. My mom leaves on Sunday and then my son is gonna be stuck with his mom that he doesn't even like/recognize all day. I already have thoughts of how much better my son and husband would be without me and this just really seems to cement that. But I can't kill myself because there's a few people who would be sad and I feel guilty about that. 

So I feel trapped in limbo. I can't escape and now my son is stuck with me and my inability to have us bond with each other is probably going to give him reactive attachment disorder or some other attachment issue.

GLevi91,"
Two weeks ago my daughter was born, so now I should be feeling myself as a proud and happy father... Instead I feel like a complete mess, who’s life now revolves around changing diapers, listening to crying, and dealing with constant sleep deprivation. I knew that having a child would be challenging, but I have never thought that it would be so hard. Also when I see my daughter, I don’t feel any happiness at all, just all the problems that ruin our lives with my wife, and for this I feel like a piece of trash.
If I knew beforehand that having a child would be so damn hard, I would probably decided not to have one. But I can’t turn back now and the problem is that I am constantly breaking down and crying and I feel the only solution to end this suffering is to end my life... Everything would be so much easier that way.
I know that probably my depression is emerging again:  one year ago in June I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I was visiting therapy regularly, I was prescribed with 20 mg Lexapro daily. It helped me return to my normal self. I was taking the medication for a year, when my psychiatrist recommended to taper down on the dosage slowly until I stopped taking it.

The last few weeks I have definitely not felt like myself. It’s really affecting my relationship with my boyfriend, so much to where we just about broke up. I’ve been really irritable, quick to get mad, taking things too seriously, and my boyfriend said he’s noticed that I don’t put effort into things I used to, such as getting up and making breakfast or any meal, and that I don’t eat... I started taking fat burner pills and I never have an appetite. I could go all day without eating, and I’ll take my fat burner and then go to the gym and still not eat even after that. 

On another note, it’s been really hard the last few weeks cause not only am I struggling with all that, but I just feel like my boyfriend isn’t supportive enough. He just acts like he doesn’t give a crap anything and he doesn’t like to talk about things. I was sitting there trying to have a serious talk about our relationship and I’m balling my eyes out and he just sits there on his game and says “you expect me to drop everything I’m doing for you?” And I go, “well when I’m sitting here crying my eyes out and trying to talk to you, yeah you should put me before a stupid video game.” He eventually put his headphones on and turned the volume up so high that I could hear it. That hurt really bad.

Glass-Cable2355,"So I'm just going to cut to the chase. Two and a half months before my wife gave birth, she told me that for the last month she was feeling disassociated and feeling like nothing was real. She told me she had been having a month long affair. I forgave her and we've been in the process of working on healing and our marriage. She's had weird and off days where's she's seemingly rebounded and texted the guy or run away from home. 

To give a little backstory, we had a miscarriage, got pregnant again, and then went into COVID lockdowns. Everything was and has been getting better slowly but surely. We've had lots of very hard days and lots of very good days, but slowly things have been feeling better and better. After much battle and debate I finally got my wife to talk to her OB about her depression and she was prescribed Zoloft. Things continued to be back and forth rough days/good days, but one thing I could always count on was that during at least all the good days, she assured me that she wanted to work on our marriage and be together.

Fast forward to post birth and things slowly started going down hill. Our baby is nearly a month old now and every day has been a little bit more concerning than the last as far as her mental health goes. I found alcohol in her handbag. She had picked it up after her postpartum appointment at the OB because she said she was just feeling so broken. The OB upped her zoloft from 50 to 100

A few days ago we went out on the town after leaving our two little critters with my family. We had a wonderful time, some alcohol was involved but not much and we have plenty of milk reserve for baby. We came home and her phone alarm was going off. I turned off her alarm for her since she was out of the room, and her phone was open to a conversation between her and the guy. The texts were just a lot of ""I'm not going to talk to you,"" ""well I'm not going to talk to you either, I've just been getting a lot of private calls and was wondering if you kept calling me,"" etc. 

I showed her the screen and it was like a light switch flipped. She started hollering, screaming, calling me names, telling me she didn't want to be with me anymore. It was out of nowhere. She was semi under the influence. But I feel like my light at the end of the tunnel is gone. She no longer wants to be married to me or so she says. She left that night saying she was going to go meet the guy. She came back and said she hadn't, she had just said that to hurt me and has since apologized. 

I'm just at a loss. She just closes up at any talk of emotion or any hard conversations and is slowly becoming harder and harder to get to open up. We have a counseling appointment and I'm trying to get her to agree to seek therapy and to talk to her OB again but she's very against it at the moment. Could any of her new behavior be attributed to postpartum/increase in anti depressants? I just need help.

foreveryoung94,"I had my first baby in July. A healthy little girl. With her best interest in mind, I made the difficult choice to do an open adoption. I want her to have the absolute best in life and I know I cannot provide that to her right now. I get to see her whenever I request, which has been every couple of weeks. 

I am 26 and already struggled with depression. Her father and I are not together, we broke up shortly before I found out I was pregnant. He has been involved and visits her with me.

I went back to work full time exactly two months after giving birth. I now do not think I was ready but I had an amazing job opportunity that I couldn’t pass up. I am responsible for all the bills and am completely exhausted. 
I feel the lowest I’ve felt since I lost my mom in 2013. Some days I feel okay and some, like tonight, I feel completely lost. I have random breakdowns and just want to give up. I don’t have her with me and I miss her every single day.

I haven’t seen a doctor since her birth due to insurance. However, my new insurance should be taking place soon. I tried a few counselors, but none had experience with adoption or postpartum depression and weren’t exactly helpful. 

This is all so new to me and I feel alone. I feel like I have to put on a fake smile all day, every day. I don’t know where to turn and just have a drowning feeling. I’m trying not to fall back into my old addictions and habits but it’s so hard, especially since she isn’t with me everyday.

InTheTreeMusic,"So, this isn't my first bout with PPD, or even the worst. But it's 100%making me hate my partner, and sometimes my baby.

Baby is almost 12 weeks old. She should be less fussy. But she literally cannot be set down without crying. Sometimes I will get 5 minutes, maybe once a day. But usually it's instantaneous. So I wear her a lot, which doesn't completely solve the problem, but at least she's *less* fussy. We also cosleep. So I have 23 hours a day where I am holding her. It's driving me insane.

My partner has a range of mental health stuff of his own to deal with, and his anxiety makes him critical at the best of times. He's having a hard time dealing with baby as well, though he doesn't really say so. But he's holed up in our room most of the weekend (to be fair I have four older children, two of which he doesn't get along with at all). It's a lot when we also have a 2 year old and a newborn together.

The being absent is whatever. It irritated me at first that I cook 50% of dinners, do the dishes every night, do everyone's laundry (to be fair, I only sometimes do his), etc etc. He does take the trash out some of the time too. But I know he's having a hard time so I can pick up the slack.

But when he does come out, he constantly picks at my daughter (4) for *everything*. She's got some form of ADHD, she's hard to deal with, I get it, but it's *constant*. I feel like she can't breathe without irritating him in some way.

Then there's me. When the big kids aren't home he follows me around like a puppy. I'm trying to care for two children, one who *will not stop crying* but god forbid I don't act enthused aboht the cute puppy gif on reddit when he's shown me 20 in the past 10 minutes. Usually when I'm trying to do the dishes while wearing baby.

Every once in awhile, maybe every 3 or 4 days, there will be a magical moment when all the kids will be asleep and even baby will let me set her down in the swing and I might have 10 minutes of time for me. Then he wants to have sex. Don't get me wrong, I like sex, but there's a laundry list of things I would rather do with that time and *none* of it involves touching another person.

I love him. He's really not a bad guy and has largely been a good parent to our 2 year old, though he's always been less involved then me. I think me being responsible for my older kids kind of set that dynamic. But not I just find myself so *angry* at him.

Idkausername111,"I am 6 weeks PP and everything my partner does makes me want to scream at him. 

I am currently on maternity leave so I am with our daughter 24/7, he works every weekday. When he gets home he usually goes and piddles in his man cave or hunts until dark. He will take a shower and eat supper and finally take her so I can at least take a shower and then he goes to bed shortly after. 

When he gets home he asks me “what did you do today?” As if keeping our daughter alive isn’t enough. I try to clean as much as I can, but she just will not stay asleep once I put her down. I try my very best to get things done, today I made the bed, took the trash out, organized the bathroom closet, and did her laundry. It’s all I could do because she kept waking up crying anytime I would start something productive, and it took every ounce of energy I had to do these simple tasks. 

Any time I ask him to take her or do something for me he acts like it’s the end of the world or it’s not important. He takes so long to even register that I asked a question most of the time I will just get up and do it myself, but I just want to yell at him for it. At night he sleeps like a rock and makes noises in his sleep, he puts his arm on me and I just want to break it. 

I see now why people break up after they have a child. I know a lot of it is my fault because I feel as if I know best about what she wants and needs so if he isn’t doing something the way I like it I take over. But half of the time he just doesn’t do anything.

b3ani3s__mama_939,"I had undiagnosed PPA with my first 5years ago. But now I'm on Sertraline since 28w gestation with this baby who is now 12w old. 

No anxiety like before but now I hate spending time my older daughter ? I feel like she is just so annoying. Everything she does gets on my nerves. All her favorite shows and youtube videos make me crazy. She won't play on her own so constantly complaibg that she's bored. She's so bossy when I try to play with her that I just get angry and say I'm wasting my time, like its her way or the highway with play. If I try to set up an activity for both of us she just whines about how she wants to do something else. I just want her out of the house all the time. She gets so mad at the baby because I ""have to spend so much time with her"". But if I try to set aside time for just the two of us it's NEVER ENOUGH. No matter how much of myself I'm peeling away to give to her she needs MORE. I spent almost TWO HOURS with her this morning snuggling, playing a video game together and talking, then I poured her a bath and gave her a bath bomb, but she hates being alone in any room so she's throwing a fit about how she wants me in the tiny ass bathroom with her. But the baby is now awake and I need to feed her and then pump and keep her happy now, and I still have a boatload of dishes to do and laundry to fold and halloween costumes to finish sewing and I've got a needy baby and an even needier 5yo!!! UGH! She wasn't like this (or I wasn't like this?) Until the baby was born. Now suddenly she's needy AF and can't seem to do anything by herself.

I sent her to grandmas house yesterday at lunch time and just said like I need a break take her as long as you want. She loves grandmas house. Hubs was home for a few hours before finally asking if I was going to pick her up and I said no. Not yet. I'll wait until bedtime or when grandma wants me to. He asked ""don't you miss her?"" And I snapped ""nope. Not at all. Everything I do is constantly being criticized by her (anything fun, anything for baby) or being undone by her (cleaning, tidying, she's a fucking tornado, then complains if I pick up after her). So nope. Don't miss her"". He said that was rude. And I agree. I don't want her to know that I so sorely enjoy her being GONE! But I feel like my level of ducks about her feelings is dwindling every day because I hate spending time with her. I almost want her to hate me so she'll leave me the fuck alone.

I'm TERRIFIED of schools closing again because those 2 or 3 days a week without her are the only time I feel like I can breathe. I seriously don't mind anything with the baby, the baby is a baby, her needs are needs and she cries when something is wrong not just because she's a little bitch like big sis. 

Ugh. I know she's just a sweet 5yo who wants her mommy all to herself but I just can't 😭

Markimariee,"My husband thinks my PPD, PPA &amp; PPR are all in my head. When I’m upset and tell him I’m feeling suicidal he reciprocates my behavior, I.e. being mean to me, ignoring me, having an attitude although I CANNOT help it and have explained this many times. That all being said I sleep trained my 6 MO through Ferber method. My husband and I were in a huge fight last night bc I had a mental breakdown and told him I felt suicidal and he hung up on me (sorry for going on and on). Today I tried to be the bigger person and just move on because I was feeling better. So the Ferber method says to let your child CIO over extended periods of time as days go on. I sleep trained her, by myself because he basically doesn’t know what to do with her, and tonight while she was crying before her 15 min period was up he was going into her room. I said “please don’t go in there, I have a timer set.” One minute went by and he went into her room. She is not supposed to be picked up unless she is being fed the two times a night I have trained her for. So now the entire night I will be the one dealing with her constantly waking up and thinking she gets picked up and trying to soothe her because her entire routine is thrown off. Am I wrong to be mad? I’m currently in the bathroom crying I’m so upset. I know it’s minuscule, but I worked SO hard to sleep train her, it took half a month, just me doing it. And now he went and fucked it all up because he can’t just listen to me or communicate with me. He just thinks I’m “controlling” and “don’t let him parent” when all he had to do was listen to my directions and I would have GLADLY let him in there. Can someone please tell me if I’m in the wrong?

After the 8 weeks I accepted I could only make half what she needs and that it was good I could make anything.

I don't even know why half the time. And I can't help but cry so much when it happens. 

My mom cried in front of me all the time since as long as I can remember. It always made me stressed because she also taught me you can never cry in front of anyone and everyone will think of you badly for it. I love my mom but it was really stressful.

I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to admit to it to my doc even. Yet. I had my sister here then and had a good excuse to go out. And so I did. Packed for the day. Prepped for the bub. Kissed the bub and husband good bye. And just went. 

Mothers might gasp in horror and/or shake their heads in judgement.But I have learned the hard way that self care comes from within. I needed to be out. I needed to breathe. I needed to change out of my grubby maternity clothing and comb my hair and go out. I was in constant pain from the c section. I was in pain from the milk. I was depressed, stuck at home with a 2 hour schedule. The world didn't stop for me while I readjusted myself, realigned myself for this human being that now depended on me, so I was angry too. I went away for a day. And you know what miracle happened? Both men at home survived JUST fine. 

So mothers, don't let fathers babysit. Let them be fathers. Let them parent. And before long you will know how wonderful it is to have two people raise a child.

Lost_in_my_Mind98,"I'm pretty sure my husband is suffering from PPD or post-natal, whichever you want to call it. My son is 7wks old, and 2 weeks ago my husband had a major breakdown. He wasn't sleeping as well anymore because of the baby, and the lack of sleep made him dread going to work in the mornings, and he took out his anger frequently with his words towards our son and I. Which I understand, I can't say I haven't yelled because the baby wouldn't stop crying etc. Anyway, he got to the point where he stopped going to work, he called in for a week straight (which would be somewhat fine if I wasn't an unemployed stay at home mom). His mood was worse day by day. One day we got into an argument because he thought I wasn't doing enough, I thought he wasn't doing enough etc. He yelled, broke the wooden dog gate out of anger. Then he took his belt and locked himself in the bathroom. I saw the shadow under the door of him sitting on the floor against the door. I couldn't believe what he was trying to do. I yelled and banged on the door, threatened to get the neighbor to come break it down and call the police if he didn't open the door. After being silent for a minute, he did finally yell at me to leave him alone. At least I knew he was still alive. I managed to unlock the door from the outside and open it a few inches, and I demanded he give me the belt. I got ahold of part of it eventually, but he would not let it go, and we basically played tug of war for a minute before I finally stuck my leg in and kicked at him to get him to let go of the belt. I finally got it, and threw it in the trash. I had to call his mom to come for back up, she is good at talking people down, and he will listen to her over me usually anyway. Plus I had to take care of our son who was crying at this point from hearing us yelling/struggling. Not the life/examples I want to set for my son, thankfully he is still very young and may not remember. While waiting for his mom to arrive he did try to leave the house on foot (I took the car keys because he said he would drive into the lake), and he didn't have his new phone yet (he threw it against the wall and broke it earlier that week) so I wouldn't have known where he was. I threatened to make a big scene in the front yard to our neighbors if he tried to leave. Mom gets there finally (she's a 30 minute drive from us) and sits with him a few hours and they talk about random whatever until he is calm and feels slightly better. Next day he says he doesn't want to go back to work until we go on some sort of vacation. So eventually I give in, and make preparations for us to go to the beach and stay in a hotel. The beach is 5 hours away from us. He seems okay the first day, he plays in the waves at the beach for hours, all the while I'm on the beach in the shade with the baby, taking care of him. Next day doesn't go so well, he has 3 really strong long island iced teas, he said he thought he could handle it, he could not. Sun was going down, was getting cold, and I wanted to go back to hotel. He said he would need at least 3 more hours before he was okay to drive, I didn't want to wait that long. I have severe anxiety about driving, I have a permit but I never drive. But I didn't have a choice, and thankfully the hotel was only 10 minutes drive away. He gets in the back with the baby, and I'm in the driver seat trying to stop worrying, trying to get myself to just go. He yells at me more and more to just go, just go. Which doesn't make me want to go, it makes me freeze up. Eventually I let more people leave the parking lot before I finally back out and go. Whole time, I'm shaking and feel sick to my stomach with anxiety, following the GPS back to hotel, trying to stay in the lines because its dark and my eyesight is worse at night. He is still yelling, then he starts sobbing and saying he doesn't want to live because all he is going to do is work until he dies and never do anything fulfilling, etc. I just try to tell him it's okay, we will be okay. He keeps sobbing, saying nothing matters, and I tell him to think of our son, and live for him. We finally get to the hotel, he says he planned getting drunk so I would be forced to drive (I think it's only partially true). I make him take his shower first, he is drunk off his ass, falls in the shower etc. He finally gets out, I have to help him with getting dressed while he is mumbling random nonsense. He then lays on the floor, rolls around and starts acting like he is going to vomit. I ignore him for like 10 minutes so I can give the baby a bath in the sink,  feed him, and get him ready for bed. Baby is finally down, and I'm trying to roll husband on his side (still on the floor) so he doesn't choke on his vomit if he does throw up. He spits up a lot of drool, and pieces of the pizza he didn't ever swallow that he tried to eat while I was bathing baby. I tell him I will get someone to come in here and roll him over if he doesn't listen to me. He eventually sobers up enough to stop slobbering, and start watching south park on the tv. The rest of that trip was just super stressful for me, and it did not feel like a vacation for me at all, I even ended up losing my phone the last day at the aquarium, which he berated me for like I did it on purpose. ANYWAY, sorry for the huge word dump. He did finally go back to work, and he isn't trying to actively kill himself anymore, but he is absent towards our son when he comes home from work. He doesn't want to feed him, change diapers, barely holds him. But he does love him. And I'm over here struggling with my own anxiety and slight depression, but I put it all on the back burner because I have my baby and my adult baby to take care of. He doesn't want to go to his counselor, I don't know how to help him. Nobody needs to even reply back to me, I just really needed to get this off my chest.  But I will read your replies if you do.

mamabluebear,"I’m a mama of three. My oldest 2 are 8 and 5 and my baby girl is 4 months old. 

I suffer from anxiety when I’m not postpartum. And this is a first for me with my third baby to have my mental issues intensified. 

The worry was creeping up. Getting more intense everyday. And then yesterday morning I woke up positive that she was dead. She looked lifeless as she slept so I panicked and picked her up desperate for her to move. She did. She opened her eyes and smiled the biggest good morning Mama smile. 

Then this morning the same thing. I woke up again. More certain today than I was yesterday that she was dead. This time I scooped her up and she was limp. I jousled her a little and yelled for my husband. And she woke up and gave me that same sweet good morning smile. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. She shows no signs of lack of oxygen. She’s pink and chubby and breathing fine not laboured. I know it was my own anxiety that caused these episodes. I know. I know? Has anyone ever heard of something like this? I still feel like something must be wrong. What if it wasn’t my anxiety. What if I saved her life 2 mornings in a row. What if I won’t make it tomorrow in time. What if this is an underlying condition of some sort!?

As a father, I really struggled with the first six months of my child's life and now see that I was not at all well during that time. Part of my blog, but part of my question overall, is do you think we struggle to define male PPD because as a society we're still unclear on what healthy fatherhood actually looks like?

hey3276,"**TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!**

I was diagnosed with severe postpartum depression &amp; PTSD about 7 weeks ago. I gave birth 9 weeks ago. The PTSD is from a traumatic delivery of my twins. I didnt realize my water had broken two days before I went to the hospital because I was already taking a shower when it broke. So I didnt go in then. I didnt decide to go to L&amp;D until two days went by because I was having pretty bad contractions but I squatted down to pick my phone up off the floor and I had a big gush of water come out. That's when i thought my water had broken but that was just the last little bit. **Once I arrived at the hospital they realized I was 6cm dilated. They tried to hook the heart monitors up to monitor the twins heart rates and that's when nurses went into panic mode and scared me to death. Baby Bs heart rate was dropping tremendously and with every contraction I had it for worse. The doctor runs in the room and if I had not have been at 9cm and ready to push I was going for an emergency csection. Baby A came out first and fast because that doctor pretty much reached her arm up me and snatched him out. She was so mean. But they were rushing to get baby b out because his heart rate was dropping badly. The doctor didn't tell me anything she was doing and she took the vacuum and pretty much ripped my second baby out. WELL when he came out he was lethargic and not breathing much and the doctor acted like she hadn't done anything wrong.

Well....my sweet tiny baby b which I named Haven River died four minutes after he was born. The autopsy proved he died from trauma to his head from vacuum and his heart gave out. My baby A which is Levi Stone was and still is a healthy baby boy. So yeah that's why I have PTSD. 
All around the same time my children's father left me  3 days after I gave birth because I couldn't get over his death. IT WAS ONLY 3 DAYS AFTER I WENT THROUGH IT AND 3 DAYS SINCE MY SON DIED BUT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER IT. I was so alone and had no family or really any friends to be there for me. I had a 2 year old toddler and a newborn to fully take care of alone and had to grieve the loss of my child at the same time. 

Long story short is I haven't been able to go back to work yet since the birth because it's been hard and I just can't take it in public for a long time. I have severe panic attacks and I'm working on therapy and getting better but I'm not there yet. I know I need to toughen up and get back to work I have kids to support. I've been told by family to get over it. And told to grow up panic attacks and depression and PTSD isn't real. They just don't know. I'm struggling so bad right now and desperately need baby formula for my baby son and diapers for both the baby and my toddler. My toddler has NO diapers as of now and my baby has ONE bottle worth of formula left. I've cried for the past hour because I hate myself because I haven't worked and now my sons have to suffer. I'm going to force myself back to work this Saturday. I have to do something now though to get the formula &amp; diapers. I called we have no diaper bank around here and the food bank doesn't have any formula that my son can eat nor diapers. All their diapers are usually gone instantly and they have no clue when they'll get more. I go to wic with my baby Friday so I just need to get him some to last til Friday afternoon. But I'm stuck on diapers and wipes..what can I do or where do I go from here? NO I AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING FREE OR ANY HAND OUTS..I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT WORKING AND THATS WHY I GOT HIRED BACK AND WILL BE BACK WORKING THIS SATURDAY.

throwaway958473662,"My mother is a very emotional person.  She loves me way too much.  I know that sounds odd, but my problem is that she tries to live through her children.  She has never taken time for herself to truly be happy and experience life.  She uses “positive thoughts” to keep any of her problems hidden.  Only thing is, she isn’t very good at masking her emotions.  She will get into manic states and her voice changes, holding back tears and almost hyperventilating.  She is in a new state since we told her we are having a child.  She loves to live in the world of children, as she was a daycare teacher for over 20 years. She loves the innocence of children.  She still refuses to admit Santa clause isn’t real....I’m 36.  My wife was having a lot of anxiety coming up to the expectation date, and my mother kept texting her everyday asking how she was doing, and saying things like “it’s the most wonderful experience”. “There is no joy like a new child”. “You will love him so much”. “Don’t you just feel wonderful?” And so on.....Our birth didn’t go as planned.  Instead of a home birth we ended up having an emergency C-section.  For a moment I thought I was going to lose my wife and child.  It was the most horrifying moment in both of our lives.  Fortunately everything went well and we have a healthy baby boy.  She is aware of the situation and I had asked her to give us a bit of time to settle in and decompress the experience.  She called every day with more “just look at the bright side”. “All that matters is that baby boy”.  And won’t stop saying how much she wants to kiss and hug the baby.
We are in a global pandemic and the hospital has suggested no visitors for a month and no people kissing the baby.   I don’t even want her to come look through the window at him, as I know how insanely emotional she is going to get.

LongingWestward,"So I had PPD/PPA after my I had my son (almost 17 months) that ended up throwing me into a whole episode while I was alone on a business trip 2000 miles from home. My husband was working the whole time and I was trapped with my very very needy baby, under diagnosed PPD/PPA, and my MIL (who was supposed to be helping me) was basically MIA. I had been working with a therapist for like 2+ months and reached out to her as I was having some seriously crazy thoughts. I let her know it was an emergency and she said she would call me back within 30 minutes. I didn’t hear from her for two days. 

I was luckily able to talk to one of my BFFs (also a mom), who talked me through the worst of it, but that episode and the broken trust with my therapist meant that I shut down. I decided I would do it on my own, like every other effing hard thing in my life, and just push through. Here I am, almost 11 months later with.... a lot of issues. I’m realizing now that I never got through it. My husband and I had a come to Jesus fight (on our anniversary. Yay) where I asked him if he thought I had depression/PPD and he told me he was actually wondering if I’d developed bipolar disorder (sorry if that’s not the right term). My symptoms don’t fit bipolar, but I do have mood swings, as well as a host of other issues that read like lingering or unresolved PPD/PPA issues.

So the big problem now is that I’ve reached out to four different providers/practices: one isn’t accepting new patients and two don’t work with women past the one year mark. They keep trying to send me to generalized practices, one of which was the fourth one I contacted and they “don’t have anyone who works with perinatal issues”. 

Wtf. I just want to get fucking help. We spend all this time trying to destigmatize perinatal mood disorders and encourage women to get help and then when we do, we are let down and told “sorry, your disorder isn’t right for us”. 

I am literally in tears. I promised my husband that I would find someone this week and after getting turned away by four practitioners, I am feeling too drained and defeated to keep calling people. I’m a SAHM with very little support ATM and I’m at the point where I’m so tired and overwhelmed by the enormity of the issue that I just want to quit. Like “fine. Divorce me. Take the kid. I’m too fucked up to be a good mom anymore, clearly.”

reeseaddict,"Hello! I am 4 weeks PP and I have generalized anxiety disorder and depression, and a history of PTSD. Currently I see a therapist and a psychiatrist and am on Effexor. I was on Effexor through my pregnancy and I do feel like it kept a lot of my APD symptom in check. I actually didn't know APD was a thing until I saw a post here.

TL; DR at end.

During my pregnancy I had a lot of struggles because my pregnancy was also high risk and my OB was awful. She would always be commenting about my baby's weight and it made me feel like I was doing everything wrong during my pregnancy. Thankfully she wasn't the person that delivered my LO, so at least that memory was okay.

I never felt bonded to my LO during my pregnancy but I let myself be okay with that because mostly I was just so focused on what I was eating since I had been warned about gestational diabetes and my LO's size. My anxiety was through the roof towards the end because of all of the things I felt like my partner and I had to get done before the baby was born. Getting the nursery ready, setting up all the furniture, cleaning the house, all of those were done with frantic energy and no sense of joy or excitement.

Now that I have my LO I feel upset that I didn't really experience any joy or excitement. I realize that I'm going through the same thing now. There are times when I am happy and I feel bonded to my LO but there are other times when I just shut down completely, I do it automatically, I guess as a way to protect myself from feeling anything too strongly.

I am struggling with breastfeeding too. I have low supply. My left nipple always seems to be sore. My LO used to have a good latch but seems to have regressed.

I know my therapist is going to tell me to stop breastfeeding but I am not ready to give up on it yet. I don't know if it is because it is the one thing about my plan for this baby that I can still have (baby was born in an unplanned c section after more than 24 hours of labor) or if I'm just being stubborn. I've started taking supplements to help increase my supply but who knows if they will work. I want to be able to move to pumping only if breastfeeding doesn't work out but my low supply worries me.

Mostly I just don't know where to go or what to do.  I really don't feel like upping my Effexor is the right thing to do but I also don't want to keep going like I am because while I can have a few good days in a row the depression and sadness is always hiding there, waiting to overwhelm me. I really can't even put a finger on what causes it or triggers it.

TL; DR: A kind of sadness rant about not knowing that APD was a thing. Sometimes I feel bonded to my LO, sometimes I feel just overwhelming sadness and depression so I shut down. I have a therapist, psychiatrist, and am already on Effexor because I my generalized anxiety disorder and depression, and history with PTSD. I really don't want to up my Effexor but I'm just not sure what to do. Also having issues with low supply and breastfeeding. I know my therapist will tell me to stop breastfeeding but I don't want to and I don't feel like that is going to help me. I really don't know what to do or how to figure out what triggers my sadness or depression.",Postpartum_Depression,Unsure what to do about depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/j6t5mi/unsure_what_to_do_about_depression/,1602110493.0,2020-10-07 15:41:33,

NicotineSolitude,"21 years old with a 3 month old son and a history of severe depression.

Before I got pregnant it was finally getting better and I met my boyfriend. It wasn't perfect but I finally felt happy and thought I had someone who will love and accept me for who am.

Fast forward 2 years and we have a son. We didn't marry because neither of us believe we should force a marriage because of our son. If we wouldn't do it without him, then we wouldn't do it with him.

And guess what? That was a very smart decision on our part because... I can't stand him anymore.


I knew he wasn't all that mature and I didn't really blame him. We are young and inexperienced. But when we both agreed that we can't abort because of our moral codes, I at least expected that having a child would give him some wake up call. Make him more mature. Think about more than just his selfish needs and expectations.


3 months post partum, and I fucking resent him. When I gave birth, I did it ALL by myself for the first month. I didn't ask him to do anything because I didn't believe I should tell him to take care of his own child. I thought it would be common sense for him to step up and do it. I thought it would be common sense for him to realize I'm physically destroyed and need help.

Nope. Did it all by myself in silence while he continued his carefree teenage life like before. Playing games and messing around. I questioned how he isn't embarrassed to leave me to do everything on my own.
At one point I didn't have time for him because he left me on duty 24/7.

He had actual audacity to tell me he feels neglected. He asked for sex 2 weeks pp and was surprised to hear I can't and that I'm still bleeding. Like, what the fuck did he honestly think? That im made out of rubber and just stretch to pop the baby and then go back to normal immediately for round two?

Zero fucking knowledge or will to get informed.


A person would think, well maybe he just doesn't have experience with babies. Maybe he was scared. We are both equally experienced with children. We're not.

The only baby I ever held, interacted with or fed was exactly my son. Nobody asked me if I'm ready. Nobody asked me if I know what I need to do. Nobody explained shit to me. They gave me my son and I had to do it. I had to figure it out on my own. I had to figure him out on my own.

But somehow, my boyfriend deserved some kind of special treatment and ""time"". Fuck his time. I have no time because of his time.



When a whole month finally passed and I got tired of his shit, I told him my feelings. His response was ""well why didn't you ask?""


Ask? I didn't know that men can just enjoy life childfree until their wife specifically tells them to do something.


3 months have passed and he's finally taking care of our son. But honestly, it's too late.


When people say first impressions matter, they're correct. And the first impression was absolute garbage. It literally doesn't matter what he does now because any sympathy or love for him has evaporated from me. The saddest part about it is, he isn't even trying to make up for that month.

Now hes complaining how tired and exhausted he is. After feeding him 2/8 bottles in a day he just passes him onto me.

That's all he does. Diapers and bottles. He doesn't wash the bottles. He doesn't bathe him. He doesn't hold him. He doesn't entertain him. He doesn't do exercises with him. He doesn't know which medicine he takes or when. He doesn't bathe him. He doesn't know how to change his clothes. He doesn't iron his clothes. He didn't buy him a single damn thing. Not a single pack of formula we feed him. Not a single bottle.


I made him ""suffer"" the night duty because I want to sleep in peace. Ironically, my son sleeps through the entire night. So he isn't even under any duty until late morning.

He has no idea what I went though the first month.


But acts like he's rhe biggest victim and that we're somehow ""equal"".





I love our son. But I can't stand his father. He managed to ruin 2 years of my love for him in a single month. It's irreparable. I don't want any fucking therapy either. These are his true colours and fuck him for that.

I don't want to medicate myself because my boyfriend is a selfish dick. This isn't a me problem. It's not in my head. Anyone would feel fucking miserable even if they didn't have depression with a sack of shit like him.



At this point I'm keeping him around because I can at least finish a cup of coffee when I wake up. If I kick him out and dump I won't get the little bit of peace I have. So I decided to suck up his nonsense for the sake of my sanity.



Since we live with my parents, my mother has become a cherry on top. I appreciate them letting us stay under their roof without paying a single bill. However she's mentally tormenting me as well.

Whenever my son cries she just comes yelling at me in passive aggressive ton ""Your child is crying! Stop smoking and get your ass up!""


Yeah. It doesn't matter that i was with him since 1pm yesterday to 6am today. It doesn't matter that his father is right there next to him perfectly capable of feeding him himself.
I need go get up and drop my only coffee and free time to tend to him yet again. I'm a shitty mother for taking 2h break in 24h a day.


She also expects me to wash everyone's dishes. To clean the entire house and cook for all of us. She expects it every day. Just like she does without a baby.


""You're not a teenager anymore.""


I'm sorry what? So I should clean, cook, wash the dishes, iron clothes AND take care of the baby. All at the same time?



What in the goddamn fuck is left for everyone else to do then?



What is this misogynistic bullshit. What the fuck have I become?


A maid? A slave?


My father sometimes tells her to back off and leave me alone. He's the last person I expected to have any sympathy for me. Yet he of all people is that person.

Just fuck everyone.


I don't remember the last fucking time I showered or brushed my goddamn teeth. Or saw anyone other than my fucking boyfriend.


I'm STILL fucking bleeding. 3 months later. Something is wrong. But I just don't even give a fuck at this point. Bleeding to death is more preferable. And even if I gave any shit, I don't have time to shower, let alone for some doctors appointment. And if I do, I'd rather drown my misery in alcohol and cigarettes.

I drink every goddamn night and stay up until 4am. Because that is the only fucking time I can have for myself and my existence outside of being a mother. And then I get up at 11 and the cycle repeats itself.

And even that is fucking ruined right now from my boyfriend munching the fucking chips in another room so goddamn loud like he's fucking 5.



I feel so fucking horrible and done. If it weren't for my son and the smile he gives me in the morning, I'd just fucking end myself right now.

grump_a_saurus,"I'm trying. I want to be the person I used to be just with one extra task of motherhood. I love being a mom and caring for my child, but I have no energy left over to clean, feed myself, bathe, or do things I used to enjoy. Its not even about not having time or support, its the energy. Its like I have such small amounts that I have to spend it wisely and I'm choosing to spend it on my daughter because I love her so much. I want her to have all the best parts of me. This lack of energy is affecting the people around me who have relied on me. I feel like I'm letting everyone but my daughter down. My partner made a comment last night saying that I coddle the baby and seemed resentful. 

When I'm not with my daughter I am fighting to get the bills and insurance under control so we don't go to collections while we wait for benefits. My girl was 6 weeks early and spent a month in the NICU so there are a LOT of bills from so many specialists and procedures and devices. I got great news Wednesday and felt so free but then Thursday it soured when they wouldn't cover the first two months of her life when the vast majority of the bills happened. I've been reelling from the devastation of having that brief moment of pure joy taken so quickly. 

I just feel so detached. I don't know how else to describe it. The pain is too much sometimes that I just can't face the emotions. I feel so unlike myself right now.",Postpartum_Depression,I am so anxious and depressed that I feel detached and unable to tap into the person I used to be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/j40ezl/i_am_so_anxious_and_depressed_that_i_feel/,1601689605.0,2020-10-02 18:46:45,
Snotface612,"I had my daughter three weeks ago. We conceived in January before the COVID crisis began. In February, my older sister died. It was expectedly unexpected. I was honest and straight forward with my doctors and nurses through the whole grieving process. But, honestly, I’m still grieving. Shortly after the funeral, lock down started so I spent the good majority of my pregnancy at home. I had a gestational diabetes scare and I was induced at 37 weeks because of gestational hypertension. After I was diagnosed with the hypertension, the doctors and nurses made a point to tell me every visit that it was okay if I began to feel symptoms of PPD after giving birth, especially with the death of my sister and the health crisis, they actually told me that it may intensify the symptoms. 

Fast forward three weeks to now. I am totally and absolutely in love with my daughter. It’s my husband and son that I’m struggling with. I’ve become combative with both of them to the point of yelling with my husband and crying fits with my three year old. I’m tired because I’m exclusively breastfeeding so no one can help with feedings. I think my husband has changed three diapers since our daughter came home so I’m doing all that. I still cook, clean, do the laundry and make sure the kids are bathed at the end of each night. 

I don’t know if I need to reach out to my doctor or if I need an intervention with my husband so he steps up. Very frustrated. Very tired. Becoming very concerned.

I am 4 months PP and I can't believe how slow time is going. I keep wanting to think it gets better but everyone keeps saying ""oh just wait till they start doing ____""... Great.

I didn't really have hobbies besides going out and now I'm always stuck at home. I'm not crafty or really active, I used to love swimming but I hate my body after my c section. I was starting to love myself after losing weight and feeling sexy before I got pregnant now I can't even look in the mirror. I hate my stretch marks that are over my old ones that were faded but they are all red again. My skin is flabby because I had a lot of fulid around the baby and my scar is the ugliest thing I've ever seen. My core feels non existent and I have a lot of pain in my back. 

I never wanted this baby even though I love her. I thought about an abortion but my man always said , ""I'll love you more after the baby is here"" , ""I'll be amazing when your pregnant."". None of that happened. He stopped having sex with me after my second trimester and I tried everything to fix it , he always told me it's him but I know it's because he wasn't attracted to my pregnant body anymore so I became a vessel for his baby rather then his fiance. He would rather watch porn while I'm frustrated. 

I also found out he was texting many other girls when I first got pregnant and for about 3 months out of our relationship. I am trying to be okay with it but who knows what else he hid. It's hard not to have resentment even if he's a good dad. I feel like he never looks at me like he used to.

I had a terrible pregnancy and was high risk, got a blood clot after and was in and out of the hospital for weeks and couldn't afford the needles I was suppose to keep taking so I always think that I still have clots. They are 20 a needle. 

I am sick of the diapers , bottles and crying when everyone I know is having a good time while I'm at home crying and staring at a wall. The rage I have is so out of hand sometimes too. I hate myself and I'm not a good mom.

I hate looking at girls who haven't been pregnant or who have and bounced back instantly.

They dont help me get to work. Even though my name is also on the car I share with my mom she says for me to make my own way. I call an uber but she cant even be bothered to open the gate thru her phone. Thwn my dad goes on and on about how hes not doing shit for me blah blah....

cosmicxsunflower,"I thought things would be getting better by now, but at 6 months, my post partum depression is peaking. I am a single mom and I’m taking a very difficult class online that requires 30 hours of school work a week. The only break that I get is when my son is in daycare for two days a week because government assistance will cover the times when I’m doing schoolwork. It’s not a break though, because I have to cram my schoolwork in to those time frames. Even if I take a small break on those days, I am behind, and it’s not enough to be worth getting behind. 

None of my basic needs are being met and I am getting resentful. I moved back home from out of state since I couldn’t afford to raise a baby by myself. I don’t have any friends out here and I’m incredibly alone. Even if I did, I probably couldn’t see them anyway. My son is 20lbs already, and I am burning more calories throughout the day than I can make up for. He is going through a phase where he can’t handle me leaving the room for one second, and if he’s not entertained every waking moment, he screams. His cries cause a strong physical reaction for me, and it sends my body into a fight or flight response. I can’t relax, rarely have time to eat, and normal things that come with the territory of raising a child like being woken up before the sun comes up are upsetting me more than they should. My first thought in the morning is how I would love to have something to eat, and I hate that I have to feed him and change him first. I feel bad for having selfish thoughts all the time, because I know he needs me.

My friend came into town last week and I was really excited to see her, but he hated his new car seat and I had to pull over twice on the ride over there to cry and console him because he was screaming. I just wanted to do one thing for myself, and it seems like anything I want to do for me is more work than it’s worth. I wanted to catch up with my friend, but it’s really difficult to maintain a conversation when my attention is always divided. 

There is a virtual new mom support group through the hospital I delivered at, but of course, it is scheduled at the exact time that I have to be at an in person lab for my class.

My son won’t take a nap unless I set him down in his room with white noise and walk away. He screams for a few minutes when I walk out, which makes me feel guilty, but if I don’t do it that way, nothing works and he will be up and exhausted the entire day. That’s the only way they could get him to nap after trying everything at his daycare, too. I’m feeling guilty all the time because he’s getting needier as time goes on, and I often dedicate my entire day to pleasing and entertaining him, and it still isn’t enough. I also feel guilty because I get angry at the little things, and I’m always thinking about how I wish my life would be about me, just a little bit. It seems like it would be easier if I just gave up on wanting anything for myself because attempts to do something for me just end in frustration.

I need to know that it gets better. In the beginning I thought it would have improved a little bit by now. I am desperate. Anybody that would listen to me vent seems to be tired of it by now, so I’ve stopped reaching out because I don’t want to drain them.

UsuallyOk247,"Hi, I’m 29, my daughter will be 15 months in a couple weeks. I also have an almost 14 year old son from a previous relationship. (If you can even call it a relationship? We were children, anyways, I digress.) 
I got ppd pretty intense after I had my son, I was a very young teenager, his dad and I broke up very soon after he was born, and got A LOT of stretch marks during my pregnancy(like from stomach to calves), so as a very young vain teenager, it was a lot. I did not get any kind of medical treatment for the depression, my high school had a lot of support groups, so that is where I got my help. 

Now to the current. I’m a new stay at home mom, I quit my job (which I loved and worked very hard at) right before the pandemic. I was exclusively breastfeeding and cloth diapering my babe, so it just made sense. My husband started a new job with quite the raise, so all was good. 
Within a couple weeks of staying home, I started to feel like I was in a rut, had no motivation, and felt so irritable with my husband for no good reason. Then COVID happened, and he got laid off. His new job has a huge pay-cut while in training and he is also working from home. So we’re home together all the time. 
I don’t know if it’s postpartum depression , hormones still off from breastfeeding, being around my husband all day everyday, the craziness of the pandemic and everything else happening in our country, or a combination of it all, but I have become a huge bitch. I don’t feel like the same person. I am so irritated all the time, my husband is very helpful with our daughter, he’s amazing with my son, he helps around the house, really he’s the best, but I find myself annoyed at him all the time. Our sex life is technically good, but deep down it’s very hard for me to get going. My sex drive is nonexistent but I know I feel better during/after so I am a willing participant, but I have to fight through these very ugly feelings in order to enjoy myself. 
I don’t feel sad necessarily, and when I’ve gone to the doctors and taken those depression screenings, they never are concerned, but I feel like I’m becoming this irritable, ungrateful person and I really don’t like it. 
To add more complexity to the mix, we always talked about having one more child, and that time to start trying to conceive is getting closer and closer. I’m starting to get so nervous because I don’t want to be this miserable wife that loves her kids but is a bitch to her super sweet husband. 
I have another OB appointment where I will talk more openly about all of this, but it isn’t until the end of October. 
For the most part we do everything we’re supposed to. Yoga, run, we read self help books together every night, we drink a lot of water, eat home cooked meals 3x a day, all the good things. 
I don’t laugh with my husband as much, I find myself avoiding eye contact with him, I quickly become annoyed while cuddling or kissing.. it truly is breaking my heart.

After I delivered my boys and got home things turned bad and he got extremely jealous of the boys getting my attention. And started pushing me, grabbing me, and them punching and slapping.

Ella_surf,"I'm hoping this can help give hope to some of you. Obviously everyone's experience is different. 

TLDR: I'm practically weaned from my anti depressants and I feel pretty good. 

I had my first (and only) in Feb 2019. Around week 4, when we realized there was no end in sight of the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad nights, and that my husband was going back to work soon, I started getting really really anxious. My anxiety was all about sleep, baby was a terrible sleeper, and when she did I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking she would wake me up any minute. One evening when my husband started throwing up from a migraine when he got home from work I knew I needed to let him sleep (he'd been taking care of the baby most nights so I could rest between feedings) and I panicked. I called my mother for help crying and she spent a chunk of the night with the baby so we could both sleep a few hours. We put a plan in place where our friends and family coordinated and someone would come by everyday to let me have a break in the afternoons, and we spent most of our savings hiring a night nurse. 

But my issues weren't going away. I got a referral from my obgyn to a psychiatrist, I started seeing a psychologist every week and got put on antidepressants and Ativan for sleeping. Once we got the right dosage, the psychiatrist told me to see my GP a year later to wean off. Last month was a year later. I discussed the timing (hello pandemic) with my GP and she convinced me to try weaning anyways. As of now, I'm practically completely weaned off and I have seen no change in my feeling good since. Sleep is still difficult sometimes, but the gp have me some other meds that are more appropriate for sleep now that I've stopped breastfeeding. 

I was really scared to go on meds, but I'm so glad I did. I can barely remember the first few months of my maternity and I'm sad the depression took those away from me, but I am so thankful that I go to enjoy the rest of my baby's life. I remember clearly having a blast with my 6 month old and feeling so happy that the meds allowed me to enjoy that time. 

I was so so lucky to have the support system, finances, knowledge and medical access to get the help I needed. I am also so proud of myself that I asked for help, that I took the meds even though I was scared I'd be a slave to them for the rest of my life and that I've been making efforts to exercise more and have better sleep hygiene (that's still a work-in-progress).

As soon as I sit he cries. He used to always be very content. He would go in his swing a bit or play on his mat and now when I put him down he cries. 

I've just been walking around with him crying. Just feeling overwhelmed. I can't get anything done because he wants to be held. The only time is the evening when my husband is home and then I'm wo exhausted but theres supper to be made and bottles to be cleaned and laundry to be done.

nano_tech3,I've been dealing with PPD/PPA for almost 3 months now. Today was not a good day. My new born got his shots this morning and has been crying since due to the pain. Later in the afternoon I had to take my 5 year old to the dentist. It was a little rough since he didn't want to go so I had to bribe him with a happy meal. After his appt. I kept my promise and went to our nearest McDonald's and got him his meal. But then I noticed that they didn't give me his drink so I had to go back. For some reason this really upset him. We got home and he was just having the worst tantrum ever. He refused to eat and wanted to throw away his food I just bought. So I put it away and took him to our room so he can lay down and relax. This upset him even more and he said that I was going to go to jail and the cops were going to take me. So I said ok and walked out. He then locks our bedroom door so I went to open it because he can't unlock it himself and he's standing at the door with a box cutter. Luckily it's one that locks and he can't open. So once he sees me he tells me I need to die and leave. He's never acted like this. So I talk to him and he's more focused on the fact that I'm crying and asking why I'm said and I tell him because of what he said. I told him I was going to leave since that is what he wants. He runs to the door and locks it and tells me he's sorry but that it was my fault. I said I knew he was sorry and that it was ok but I still ended up leaving. I'm currently at my grandparents grave crying bc I don't want to go home.

chubby_gengar,"Through a hookup from a friend I was able to secure a job until we move. It pays great and will allow me to save up for the move and will allow us to be paid up for a while. It’s a great job and I love it but it’s just not feasible for us to live where we are now- the price of living is way too high and it’s great pay but it’s not living great. Where we’re moving too my husband and I have been applying but it’s difficult if you don’t live in an area to apply for jobs because people often want physical interviews.

Husband has gotten many calls back and has a potential (great) job up there but if he isn’t able to there are tons of places that I’ve found that are hiring and have called me back as well. We also found a super amazing apartment that we’ll say without a job would be impossible to maintain but with either of us working we’d be fine. He’s now being so pessimistic and it’s so freaking frustrating because I feel like I’ve finally dragged myself out of this draining hole and things are looking up and he says things like “well we’ll see how it goes” and “hopefully she gives us our deposit back if we can’t find jobs” and I know they’re very reasonable fears but we were both so on board and I don’t know what happened- he’s also not the type to tell me until after the fact.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting but I’m beyond frustrated because I’ve been the only one looking for places and jobs for both of us, it feels like, and each time I get shot down I lose so much hope and I finally found SOME and it’s like I can’t even have that. Don’t even get me started on the job- it’s ideally my dream job and I can work up to get to where I’d want to be but it’s unrealistic to think that we could stay where we are and I get that but it’s absolutely amazing.

Arty-meows,"These fears started after i suffered through a panic attack that spanned about 24 hours after using goodys powder (a fast acting migraine powder) BEFORE i got pregnant. I felt like i was in hell. I suffered panic attack after panic attack and could barely function. I would get a panic attack after a temperature change, or miscounting money. I couldnt drive. I couldn't eat. I couldnt sleep. I was paranoid of dying 24/7. 

However i became pregnant shortly after and then it turned into fears of losing the baby, and then also dying. I spent most of my pregnancy paranoid about counting kicks, and pre ecclampsia and the like. Basically hypochondria. 

I spent all of my childs early months worrying non stop about losing her. It got to the point i actually couldn't be away from her, and she slept next to me in bed. I would wake up at every movement to check on her. I still do. My child is 1, and i see posts occasionally about someone losing their child out of random and it sends me into an intrusive thought hell. 

Obv i know therapy would be nice, but i need an in personality therapist and i get too comedic when I'm talking on video chat. I just want to enjoy being a parent. I hate seeing posts about people losing their children at 2 or 3 or 4 or something. My life would literally be ripped away from me and i would not be able to continue om without my baby.

Tziporah-296,"Nobody will read this. But I need to type this to make myself feel better.

I have not been one to admit that I have faults. I want to be perfect and try and act like my life is perfect, but that is never the case with anyone. Only God is perfect. 

For the past few years, I have struggled with sporadic anger and sadness. It comes and goes every few months, but I put it off as hormonal changes because my period was all wacky and I was trying to become pregnant and was pregnant. Once I had my baby 4 months ago, I was in total bliss. The nurses as my hospital warned me of postpartum depression, and they gave me all these resources to fall back on in case I thought i was suffering from it.

Then it happened.

My fiance and I will fight about the dumbest things, and usually we make up right away and move on. But two nights ago, I thought the cops could have been called. Read on my other two posts if you wish to know the details, I don't want to make myself more depressed trying to retype everything. I didn't harm myself or anyone, don't worry. I just made a lot of racket, stomping and screaming like a toddler over the dumbest argument ever. I cried and cried, screamed, kicked, stomped...I wanted to run away. I wanted to pretend I didn't exist. I wanted to wish I never met anyone or had a baby, or became a mother. 

How could I think such a thing...what kind of a mother am I?

I used to be so happy and bubbly...people used to tell me they always saw me smiling. My cheeks would often hurt from it. People told me I was kind, fun to be around, and an all around sweet person.

But now I feel like total shit. Every day Im sad and I just want to cry and sleep and not work...but worst of all...I feel angry and I don't know why. I decided to finally do something about it. I hate taking pills...I don't like being ""diagnosed"" with anything. I want to think Im perfect...but I'm not. So I set up an appointment with my doctor next week. Not gonna lie, Im a little nervous to go. I don't wanna take pills....but I might need it. Or yoga...or God...or meditation or aromatherapy...

To make myself feel better, Im going to spill out my feelings here. Im going to explain how much my baby means to me. Im probably gonna cry.

When she was born, I was washed over with extreme happiness...total bliss. I felt almost a godly love pouring out of me. Its hard to explain. I remember hearing her little cry...her warm and slippery skin...feeling her trembling body on my chest. Her little body was so warm and she whimpered so helplessly. I couldn't sleep...I kept checking to make sure she was breathing. I even pushed her little cart into the bathroom with me when I went to pee or take a bath because I didn't want to take my eye off of her. I was so in love....and still am. The first thing I noticed were her teeny fingernails. She has furry thighs which makes me laugh.

She is absolutely beautiful. Big blue eyes like the icy waters of Lake Michigan, smooth olive skin, and brown hair like sweet milk chocolate. Her toothless smile melts my heart...her dimple on her chin makes me think of her father. I love looking at her tiny little fingers. She loves to coo and crow at me when I breastfeed her. When we are together, I don't want to do anything, I don't want to be anyone. I don't want to think or do anything at all but hold her close and talk to her, hug her, and kiss her little face...and tell her all my deepest secrets. Her name is Lilly. And she is my daughter...and I love her very much.

I cant wait to watch her grow into a little young lady. Maybe when she is 24 like me, she will read back on this.

HoneyNutFruitLoop,I am 34 years old and I have five children. My youngest is a girl named Faith who just came home from the NICU Monday after 199 days. She was born at 26 week gestation. The social worker at the hospital where she was in the NICU set up a pediatrician appointment and a WIC appointment before we were discharged and the pediatrician appointment is Friday at 3:45pm and WIC is Monday at 11:30am. When we went home the nurse gave us a few samples or bottles or RTF of the formula that she eats. She has to have Elecare specialty formula because she has severe digestive issues and cannot tolerate dairy or certain amino acids. We just ran out completely of the formula that they sent home with and due to my job firing me the day I went into labor prematurely because I had to leave work to rush to hospital. I have Zero money to be able to buy a can because going back and forth to the NICU for 199 days and taking care and supporting my other children wiped me out. I didn't save any money to buy any because the nurse said she thought she sent enough until WIC but NO it wasn't. I had never priced the Elecare formula until today and it is $42.44 PER CAN and I mean just ONE can.  I need to get a can as soon as possible because she has to eat every three hours and I have 41 minutes til it's time. you guys I have asked ally friends and family for help and no one can help. I went to my local social services and talked to a worker about help and she called food banks and things for charity and NO ONE has the Elecare formula. Local churches turned us down and said they had no funds and couldn't help. I have cried all afternoon and night and begged God to send help and idk I am losing hope. I feel like such a useless mother that has failed her daughter. She has to eat and it's very important for her because her being a preemie and still tiny she has to grow. So I'm asking for help! Yes I said it..I know I will get bashed and talked shit to but everyone told me that I should never be afraid to ask for help for my children and etc. Well here I am and hope and pray that someone will help my girl out so I can rest easy. I'm just tore up inside not knowing what to do. If any one could help us to get the Elecare for my daughter to be able to eat o will be so grateful and couldn't thank you enough.

rodznjodz,"I was diagnosed with PPD/PPA several weeks ago and was drowning in it about a month ago. My husband and I live 10 hours away from family, and our son is now 7 weeks old. We’ve been completely isolated from people since March. My mom came to the rescue three weeks ago to help out with the baby since I also had to start working part time again. It’s been night and day as far as my emotions go having someone else beside me to help. I’ve felt like I can function more. Last week, I hit a dark place and was so angry with my baby that I wanted to just throw him. I didn’t, but when that thought crossed me mind, it broke me. I sobbed and felt like that was the final straw for me. I realized then that I can’t keep living this far away from my family in the mental state I’m in, so we’re moving back home. My husband saw how much I needed help and knew this would be best for our family, so he resigned and is going to be staying home with the baby while I continue to work remotely. It’s been an absolute whirlwind packing our things to move, but knowing we’ll be back home and close to our support system brings me relief. I have my moments of guilt that it’s come to this because “I can’t handle being a mom”, but I keep telling myself that I need to do what’s best for my family, and being near my own family who can help us has majorly improved my state of mind.

chubby_gengar,"So when I was beginning my journey of motherhood I had a pretty rough start. Since then I’ve begun therapy and will soon be medicated for it, which is super great. My husband and I have also been facing what seems like impossible odds and we’ve been doing alright. But now we’re moving 300 miles away from family and he’s getting a job so now he’s saying that he’s not going to be helping with the night shift.

A little preface. I was alone for a little under 3 weeks because he was looking for a job in a different state and was staying with family. And all that time, more or less, I did nights and days and all he said was I’m sorry I’m not there. Since he got back he’s been phenomenal and has really helped when he senses I might need a little break. But his job would require him to work afternoons and evenings but probably nothing past 8 or 9. I understand that he’ll be tired and will need rest for work (it’s assumed I’ll be a SAHM which I don’t mind socially, but personally I would love a job) but it just makes me feel really shitty knowing I’ll have to be doing it alone again.

layrenee92,"Hi ladies,

I’m glad I found this sub because I feel a bit alone. I had my baby boy in March right when covid really hit so it’s been a bumpy ride. I was on Elavil 50 mg throughout my entire pregnancy and three weeks ago I quit.  It was great for depression, but the years I took it, I had severe stomach issues so I finally gave it a stop. The stomach issues seem to have subsided and my withdrawal symptoms lasted about two weeks. Now, the depression is back, I’m nauseous 24/7, I can’t sleep ( which is expected with a baby) and I have panic attacks all day. My doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine for sleep (but it only worked a day) and she prescribed lexapro. I took it for two days and was constantly puking so I just quit. I feel so hopeless and like such a terrible mom. I should be taking him for strolls or just going by the swing and I feel too depressed to even get up. I just don’t have it in me. I look at his smile, I start crying and apologizing for not being the mom he deserves. All I keep thinking is how I’m failing my son and I hate that. I’m scared of being on any type of benzodiazepines because my mom was an addict growing up and I fear I’ll do that to my son. I was wondering if there’s anyone who took an anti depressant that helped with post partum and severe anxiety (social anxiety especially). I know everyone is different, but I was hoping to hear some positive stories about being one.

magnoli-a,"My ‘baby’ is 12 months old. I have only very recently been diagnosed, however have been suffering unknowingly or in denial for months. Maybe steadily getting worse over 6 months or so. I had a traumatic and premature birth and just don’t think I had time to stop and process how I was feeling properly until it’s turned into a big monster you can’t NOT notice.

I’ve started therapy. I’m also 14 weeks pregnant. Unplanned. I’m terrified. I’m terrified of the impending deadline until this baby is born. This deadline to get my shit together. I want to be better. I will drown if I’m not. I won’t be able to do this with a newborn. My family live in a different state and due to Covid we have been in lockdown, which is definitely contributing to my struggle. 

I’m trying to be positive and focus on recovery but the pressure of needing to be ‘better’ by March is so overwhelming and stressful. I am hesitant to start medication, mainly because I’m scared I won’t ever be able to stop taking it like my mother. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? For some reason medication just scares the shit out of me even though I’ve been assured it’s safe for pregnancy. I am scared I am damaging my relationship with my son and am risking damaging the relationship with my son-to-be so am determined to improve, I guess I’m just really lacking in confidence.

esmereldaskysurfer,"PPD is always talked about, the OB screens for it after the birth, the baby's pediatrician screens for it after the birth, women are encouraged to look for signs and see a doctor if they think they might have it.

But there's one they *dont* talk about: Antepartum depression.

I found out this is a thing today, after experiencing months of dark, disturbing thoughts about my pregnancy. Not feeling connected to my baby AT ALL, sometimes not even remembering im pregnant, sometimes i would be like ""i feel like utter shit and i dont know why"" then a few minutes later would remember, oh yeah, im pregnant. Im 18 weeks and feeling the baby move, seeing them move around on the ultrasound and i feel NOTHING. Just sadness, and anger, and resentment and regret.

This wasnt a planned pregnancy, which i think is one of the reasons why i became so depressed (that and i have type 1 Bipolar, so im in a high-risk category for developing it). I feel like getting pregnant ruined my life, and have resented the fuck out of this life that has survived so many battles just to get here (i have fertility issues, so technically *cant* get pregnant without help, yet somehow did, then they didnt expect the pregnancy to survive past the 1st trimester). Yet i cant be happy. 

It didnt feel like a typical Bipolar depression, so i concluded that i must just be a shitty person who hates her baby, and even started thinking about adoption. I mentioned this to a friend who works in Mental Health, who said there were red flags all over the place in what i said, and told me to read up on Antepartum Depression. When i did, i was like ""oh but that's exactly how i feel..."". It feels, for me, a lot like PPD did when i had my first. Lots of dark thoughts about getting rid of the baby somehow (with my first i used to sit crying, thinking about taking him to a fire station and leaving him there), thinking about self harming in some way, not feeling bonded, etc.

Im going to call my psychiatrist on Monday, to talk about adjusting my meds to combat this. But even just knowing, this is a real thing and is not just me being a shitty person, helps a lot. He doesnt have an out of hours line, or i'd call that, and the local mental health support center is fucking useless because they cannot prescribe anything, so it's great if you want to sit in a room with a counselor for an hour and talk about it, but that's all they can do. My other options are the ER (no thanks, dont want Covid) or the local psych hospital where as soon as i started talking about wanting to self harm, would 5150 me for 72 hours and i dont think i need that.",Postpartum_Depression,The one they still dont talk about: Antepartum depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/ij50ti/the_one_they_still_dont_talk_about_antepartum/,1598779165.0,2020-08-30 02:19:25,

Sea-Lawfulness87,"I need to let this out. I love my boyfriend with all my heart. So much that it hurts.

A little backstory: when I first found out I was pregnant I was 4weeks along. I was scared that he didn't love me and that if I told him about the baby that he'd stay just for that. I was going to write a note saying that I couldn't handle a relationship anymore, wasn't going to tell him about the pregnancy and just terminate it. But he found out about the baby before I could. I also want to say that I was told at a very young age there was about a 2% chance of me getting pregnant, let alone going to term and baby being viable. I was about 6/7 months pregnant in October and we got into a stupid argument that got a little heated. I asked why he was with me if I made him that sad and he pointed at my belly. A few hours later he came back and said the only reason he said that was because he was mad...I believed him. 

Now:  I'm 7 months postpartum. Two days after taking baby home we argued, he told me he knew from a month into us that we wouldn't last. Took it back and said he was mad..I believed him.  Around the 1 month mark we got into another little argument while putting the crib together, we were using the basinet but baby got too big. It was a stupid argument about where to put the crib. It got heated and he admited to me that the only reason he talked me out of abortion was because he felt bad for me. That he didn't want a baby but it could be my only chance at being a mom. 
It took me a while but I realize that he did mean what he said. That I ruined his life. I hate myself for that every single day. 

I've kept all of that to myself. For nearly a year. I can't tell anyone because I'd get a big fat ""you were stupid"" thrown at me. He's the only guy I've ever been with. We were barely together a month before getting pregnant. I'm so broken and alone. I needed to get that off my chest rather someone sees this or not.

thearablife,"I just want to write it down to maybe get through one day without resenting my baby. I’m 2 weeks postpartum and I just want these feelings to go already. I’ve had them all my pregnancy and now it’s like they’re bubbling up and bursting out at the slightest trigger. My husband is overseas and there is a language barrier between us that sometimes doesn’t let me communicate what I want him to understand. 

To my husband: 

I told you when we got married that we should wait to have kids. You said you wanted to start now so we can enjoy our lives later. 

I love our son and wanted him to be enough for you for a little while but you insisted on a second baby when he didn’t even reach the 2 year mark. I told you we don’t know what will happen with the immigration. You told me you have it covered and I’ll probably deliver with you by my side. You gave me false hope. No one could’ve predicted COVID, but I told you something might happen and you only thought about yourself. 

I told you to choose between a baby or having me and our son come for another visit later in the year. You chose a baby. It broke me that you chose having a child over me which forced me to go through another pregnancy and labor delivery alone again. One week postpartum and you’re already telling me to come back to your country and travel alone with a newborn and toddler during a fucking pandemic. Are you insane? 

I had to go through postpartum pain alone again. I have to breastfeed at night and all day on demand alone again. I went through unimaginable and constant pain. I have to juggle a newborn and a jealous toddler. I’m alone and there’s nothing worse than feeling like a single mother while married. 

I’m angry that I finally have the girl I always dreamed of and I can’t even love her properly. I’m terrified of leaving her alone for one second that her justifiably jealous brother might harm her. Im scared that a kiss or hug will trigger him or further his jealousy. I’m living in a constant state of nerves and fear and anger. 

Can you stop saying “I know” or “I feel you” or “I understand” when I bring up the pain or the fears? You don’t know. You don’t feel me. You don’t understand. Trying to minimise how I feel or telling me “everything will be okay don’t worry” doesn’t make me feel better. I’ve told you this. I want solutions. I want HELP. 

You promised me a lot of things when I came back to the States. You didn’t deliver on any of them. My resentment grew from that day forth. And I wish to God I can get rid of these feelings for you so that I can finally connect to my little girl. You don’t know how these feelings for you have affected my connection to her. She was supposed to be my every dream and hope come true. Instead, I can’t find it in me to love her. 

It doesn’t help that I miss my little boy. I miss our alone time together. I miss sleeping next to him. I miss the way we were together. I hate how I can’t be with him like I used to. How the simple act of lifting him is painful for me right now. He knows. He comes to forcibly take snuggles and kisses when it used to be me offering them and that hurts me. It hurts me so much that he feels he has to do that. 

I’ve been distant with you for months but you’re so damn thick and self-absorbed that you haven’t caught on or even asked why. I’m at a breaking point and no one even noticed not even you. Im going to have a good long cry in the shower today if I can manage to grab one to help release some of this and hopefully it helps.

victoria-lisbeth,"I'm not always sad or anxious. Sometimes I get angry. Sometimes none of that is even about the baby, or me.

Sometimes I just get so angry at my husband I want to put his head into the wall. It was his turn to feed the baby, the baby was making his I'm hungry sounds. Baby quieted down so husband decides to wait until he's more awake. Well baby began to make more noise and get more agitated so I got up. Husband got offended, saying he was going to feed him. 

I snapped at him. I told him that if thats what he's going to do then do it now because the baby was about to cry and I didn't want to hear any kind of irritation or anything toward him if that happened. That if he couldn't handle getting his ass out of bed to tend to our child when he needs it right then, then to let me know and I'll handle it like I have been for the last month and a half. 

I'm still mad. Partly because he would just leave our child whimpering in his crib and partly because I've been the one to stay awake all night with the baby when needed, the one who would get up at all hours and only be able to doze at night, just to take care of him in the day while husband works from home. I've reached exhaustion and driven right by it to the land beyond.

But he doesn't want to get out of bed for one feeding? 

Now I'm spiraling between anger and depression and anxiety because of what he did and I hate it. Today was an OK day. I was managing to be pretty even. Now I'm all thrown off and its 3 in the morning.

lydlurksalot,"It’s been a year and a half since my son was born, and I am still struggling to feel normal again. PPD and PPA have left me anxious, exhausted, and sad. 

What really worries me is that it’s affecting my job. I’ve made some mistakes because I’m losing my focus and getting overwhelmed. I’m working from home since the pandemic hit. I have struggled to handle distance learning for my oldest, working full time, and taking care of my son during times when daycare was not available.

At this point, I’ve been written up for a couple of stupid mistakes at work. My boss says I’m on thin ice until I show I can be consistent. And yes, my boss knows about my ppd, and has some sympathy, but also high expectations.

I don’t know what to do to get better. I’m sure if I had less on my plate and could find time to exercise and get healthier, I could get over this postpartum hormonal imbalance. I used to be so productive. Now I can barely do anything well. I’ve overloaded.

I’ve been talking Zoloft for a few months now, and it is helpful. I’m not crying all day anymore, and am able to handle more things. I‘ve had some good therapy sessions, as well. But - I’m still struggling to take care of my family and keep my job.

I keep thinking maybe I should quit my job and stay home with the kids for a couple of years. Financially, it would be rough, but maybe possible. I could rest, make sure my kids are doing well, support my husband as he grows his career, and have time to get healthy again. I could get a certification, maybe volunteer in a professional organization to keep my resume current, and go back into the workforce when my son enters pre K. 

 I’m not sure, though, because before all this I loved my job. It is a great opportunity. And I’m afraid of leaving us with one income. 

Is there any hope I can climb out of this pit? Any ideas that can help? Should I consider quitting my job, or is there a better way?",Postpartum_Depression,PPD and PPA have me struggling to keep my job.

 I had my second c section on February 27th at 9:27 PM.. I was in labor for 36 hours and the last 15 minutes of my labor I got an epidural, then my daughter couldn’t handle the pitocin from the induction anymore and my epidural turned into a spinal and I was wheeled into the operating room.. so high I couldn’t feel how terrified I was, I could hardly keep my eyes open. 
Hearing the doctors count out the tools they are going to use.. and then the anesthesiologists behind me let me know it was beginning.. I was being cut open again. It felt like forever feeling my body being tugged around but not feeling anything at the same time.. hearing the doctor say she’s a big baby and hardly being able to focus on her above the curtain. Wanting to cry but feeling nothing at the same time, fighting to keep my eyes open to see her on the table while they cleaned her. Fighting with every fiber of my body to remember the moment my daughter was born earthside.. they wheeled me into the recovery room and my husband who never left my side watched as I was shaking trying to hold my newborn. I could see the love for her and the fear for me in his eyes.. 
the next 3 months were terrible. Panic attacks 3 or more times a day, worrying if today was going to be the day I died, not being able to go to sleep from all the adrenaline my  body was still producing.

throwaway77442424,"Not even sure where to start...
 My wife is just over 3 months postpartum with our twins. These are our first. 

The first few weeks were normal rough. Sleeping was an issue. Breastfeeding difficulties. My mother in law basically moved in to help out full time which has been great allowing my wife or myself good chunks of time to catch up on sleep when needed. 

We stopped breastfeeding because it became too much after about 6 weeks. So when we switched to formula we changed the feeding schedule. And a week later we changed it again. A few day’s later changed it again, and again and again.  I really don’t even remember why we made the changes but basically it was going back and forth between 3 and 4 hour schedules to try and fit within our twins wake and sleep windows and for a few other legitimate reasons (reflux issues, work schedules, etc.)

Long story short for the past 6-8 weeks now my wife has had this narrative that all our changes in the schedule early on have negatively effected the babies. She feels that by making so many changes we’ve altered their brains causing some sort of neurological deficiencies. She’s afraid that we’ve somehow managed to damage their development along the way. 

We see our pediatrician regularly and even see another Pediatric doctor on occasion because the twins came early and spent time in the NICU. Both doctors have seen nothing but great things with the twins. Their weight gain is on track and getting better each visit. They are hitting all developmental milestones. They are showing all positive signs (smiling, laughing, grabbing, etc). The only real struggle I see is consistency with their sleep but we’ve settled on a routine in the last month and it seems to be working. Work in progress but working. 

Sorry lot of information here but I really don’t know how else to explain it. 

So my wife keeps saying these things about how we “altered” them. We messed them up with the schedule changes, unintentionally but they are messed up etc. 

I know what she see’s is flawed. The doctors know what she’s seeing is not really there. 

Basically she’s going through this postpartum depression/anxiety/psychosis and there doesn’t seem to be anything to change her mind or show her anything different then the negative lense she’s looking through. 

She’s been talking with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now ever since her feelings started and has been taking a few different medications in trying to calm her nerves and clear her views. 

She doesn’t feel that there is anything “wrong” with her. She doesn’t believe she is postpartum even though the doctor has diagnosed her as such. 

Basically I’m just asking, is there anything more i can do besides having her continue to talk with doctors, take medicine and hopefully one day soon see how wonderful our twins are? Most days it’s like 1 step forward 3 steps back. 
Each day all she can see are these “negative” issues with the twins and no positives. No one else involved see’s anything negative and her only justification is “mothers instinct”

Sorry for rambling and hopefully you can understand my questions/thoughts. I’m just confused and looking for something to help me continue in a better direction.

I'm very new to this, but I would be so grateful for some advice. I recently moved countries, and my best friend back home just had a baby 6 weeks ago. Because of covid19 I haven't been able to visit.
Since giving birth she's been miserable, sad, hopeless, scared. Feels no connection with the baby, feeling suicidal. All the classical symptoms.
Her partner unfortunately isn't very understanding.

Gotten her in touch with a therapist and she's on some meds now to help her sleep etc. I've been reading all your messages on this forum to try and find ways to help. But she is struggling and I feel powerless. Noone in her friend/family group has any experience with postpartum depression so she feels guilty, lonely, and is losing hope. 
I call her every day but it's so hard to not be able to help more.

Awkward_Ship4354,"So I had my baby 4 months ago and he is fantastic. Really great baby, couldn’t have gotten luckier. I for whatever reason am having a very hard time focusing on the present, and being grateful for what I have. Instead I feel guilty and stressed out. 

My husband and me had him when we were 31/39. I realized after having him that we didn’t think about the long-term we just thought about when the time was right. Now I feel like we should have had him earlier and waiting was a disservice to him. 

I’m constantly worried about dying and not being around to take care of our baby. I started worrying about how I don’t have to worry about my parents getting old and dying until I’m in my 50s but our baby may have to worry about that in his 30s. I keep reading stuff about how kids hated having older parents and they ended up as caretakers at a younger age. Again, I didn’t think of ANY of this before now... 

I know I want another one too but I worry about having another one because my husband will be in his 60s when they graduate high school. I know that seems so old to a teenager... Again, didn’t think of any of this UNTIL AFTER HE WAS BORN. 

Then I read all this stuff about how parents don’t have the energy to parent in their 40s/50s, I find out that risks increase for men after 40, and the best part of having an older parent is financial stability which we DID have but we both lost our jobs, had to sell our house, and move in with my parents because of freaking covid.

Now I feel like we just selfishly waited until we were ready and we created a mountain of problems for my little guy. Every time I see him I just think about how I’m going to die and leave him all alone. I want to throw up.

The worst part of all of this is EVERYONE told me to have kids right after we got married at 24/32 and I didn’t listen. I was too scared and I wasn’t ready and now I feel like I totally messed up my kids life before it even gets started.

alex_zelda,"I'm (23F) in a rut where I both feel guilty and rage towards my husband (24M) at all times.  I feel guilty because a lot of the time, I shut down and walk away because I'm depressed, leaving him to parent our (6Month M) baby alone in that moment.  I feel rage because the reason I'm so tired is because my husband snores very, VERY loudly in bed at night, leaving me up for 1-2 hours after we turn in, and doesn't want to get help to see why he's snoring so loudly.  I feel guilty because I yell sometimes.  I was raised in an abusive household, and my husband is such a gentle soul.  He never yells at me.  Occasionally I yell at him about the stupidest things.  Sometimes he will come home from work and I'll immediately (without saying hello) ask him why he didn't put his dishes in the sink or something stupid.  These are all new problems since we had the baby.  I was incredibly depressed until I stopped breastfeeding, and now I am just reeling from how different my life is.

I used to travel around town and see a different set of faces every day for work.  Then I got furloughed.  So now I'm a stay at home mom.  I used to think that I wanted to be a stay at home mom, but not anymore.  It's so stressful.  It's like the baby knows when I'm about to eat or relax and he starts fussing for my undivided attention.  Hormones are still making me feel sick all the time.  I'm exhausted.  I can't sleep but I want to sleep.  My anxiety was OFF THE WALLS when I was pregnant, I was constantly worried about my baby because of DFM, and now I'm like ""it'll be okay"" about everything.  Paci falls on the floor?  Wipe it on my shirt, it'll be okay.  Small stuff like that.  Yet I still can't let him cry for more than five seconds before rushing to him because my mama heart can't stand to hear him cry.   My husband keeps me awake with his snoring, so in the morning (hubby works evenings for context) I tell him to take the baby out to the living room so I can sleep longer.  Only to wake 30 minutes later to the baby crying because my husband can sleep through anything and has fallen asleep on the couch.  I had a 4-day induction at the hospital in which my husband slept MUCH of the time, long, 8-hour stretches and would wake up looking lethargic.  Then in postpartum, he was asleep when the baby started crying in his bassinet.  He was screaming bloody murder and my husband was RIGHT NEXT TO HIM and slept through the entire thing.  Then when I woke him (FINALLY) He had the nerve to tell me that he was suffering from ""sleep deprivation"" (by this time we had been there 5 days and I had slept maybe six hours cummulatively).  I called my nurse to come wheel me through the postpartum ward and sobbed to her about how unfair it was that he said he was 'sleep deprived.'

The extent to which I do lash out at my husband doesn't even scratch the surface compared to the amount that I internalize.  Of all the times I feel a fire of anger go through me about some pet peeve or problem I have with him, I might mention it maybe 5 percent of the time.  Which is still too often.  I know my husband has things that bother him about me too but when I open the table to discuss our issues he just says ""It's okay hon, I know you're tired and the baby is hard to take care of on your own"" so instead of being an ass and talking about the things that are bothering me about him, I internalize them.  How could you say something negative about someone to their face right after they said that?

So yeah, I guess postpartum rage, maybe, at my husband?  But he has such a gentle way and he doesn't deserve all the rage I'm internalizing.  I keep a lot of it in because I don't want him to know.  I don't want to break him.  I know I make it sound like I am mean to him a lot but I try so hard to take the time to let him know how much I appreciate and love him.  He has been amazing through all this and has never asked me to wake up and hold the baby because he was tired.  He just also pisses me off sometimes.  And I know I'm not perfect.  He has a much gentler way of pointing out the things that I do wrong.  I'm talking to a therapist once a month which is really helping.  I love my husband and I don't want to feel this rage towards him.  It's not fair to him.  He works so so hard for our family.

fsppd,"hello,

its been an year now since i delivered but the mood swings and state of depression seems to intensify every month.

i am a 28 yr old mother with my first child born last yr, the phase i never wanted to go through for like next 3-4 yrs till i was settled in my life career wise and financially.

being a workaholic person, i wanted to study and build a career in a new country that me and my husband planned to immigrate to. but i had a unplanned pregnancy before moving to the new place and my husband really wanted me to have the baby because for him, having atleast one baby was important before it got ""too late"" to conceive. hence i had a sad sort of pregnancy because i was at home most of the time, which i never wanted to, making me more and more frustrated.

the hormonal changes made it impossible for me to study and prepare for the licence exams in the new place hence i decided i will postpone tit till the next yr. soon after delivery, i opted for a job which was some what related to my filed, so that i could go out the home and meet other people. 

i feel i have an additional burden now to look after and manage my schedule according to others now. i lack time for myself and miss going out for trips without carrying tons of baby luggage in the car. i do have parents to look after the kid but still i have to find time to spend with him along with other house hold work. i miss my old care free days where i only thought about my work and home. 

my husband has been supportive and motivates me to start studying again but i am not able to concentrate at all. the scenario was totally different 2 years back, when i had confidence and motivation and could study peacefully. 

when i see my other married friends enjoying their independent lives to the fullest, achieving things which i have missed make me feel jealous. i have cut down my phone communication to everyone because i feel i have nothing to talk about except the baby and maybe because i do not want to know how much my friends are enjoying.

i do not think i was ans still an ready for the baby and accuse my husband for making me having one so soon. PS. i had a case of uterine fibrosis and some doctors thought we should plan early. i believe i would have conceived later too and there was no need to rush.

mu husband is asking me to seek professional help but i dont want to take medicines as i feel it will make me dependent on the pills.

will be grateful if someone advises me how to come back on track in life and accept this fact that it is what is is.",Postpartum_Depression,"depressed even after 1 yr postpartum , but not willing to take medicines",https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/i7vhbe/depressed_even_after_1_yr_postpartum_but_not/,1597190476.0,2020-08-11 17:01:16,

Since birth he's just been a difficult baby, as in barely sleep at night baby, can never take a full 2-hour nap baby, always crying, always need attention, always want to be held. We tried everything to improve his sleeping (see doctors, sleep training, eat full before going to sleep,...) He wakes up on average about 10 times per night, the only way he'll go back to sleep is I nurse him to sleep. I tried to let other people put him down but he.can.not.be.put.down by anyone else but me.

I'm just always tired, stressed cause I don't get enough sleep at night or during the day. My husband works most of the time, even when he's home he can't hold the baby for too long cause he has back injury.

questions412,"I (24f) don’t wanna sound ungrateful because I am extremely thankful for my family I have created with my husband (27M). We have two girls (2f) and (1f) and most days I’m feeling so nostalgic about my past life. Before I met my husband I was a traveling escort, sugar baby and whatever else category you’d wanna put me in. I was used to making fast money, took extreme pride in my physical appearance, always looked sexy and could just get up and go at the drop of a dime to a new city. 

Being a mom sucks in my opinion. My husband is very helpful in all aspects but I still dislike having kids. My youngest is super clingy and cries for everything and especially when you try taking stuff out of her hands and mouth to keep her from hurting herself. My oldest is a bit more easier to deal with but is going thru a “terrible twos” faze and sometimes doesn’t like to listen or is sneakier than ever. I hate having to wait until the kids are tired to sleep. I hate having to be woken up to the sound of crying. I hate having to change someone else’s messy diapers, it makes me sick to my gut. 

I hate having to always share my meals even when the kids are being fed the same exact thing. I see everyone else who is childless that I know traveling left and right and it sends me into depression because that used to be me. Most days I haven’t any enough energy to even shower. I tried buying nail supplies and makeup from amazon to give myself a hobby but I can never get into it because someone is always needing attention. I honestly hate it here and sometimes wish my husband and I would split so I wouldn’t feel guilty about not keeping the kids, I kind of would want to get rid of them. Either by him taking them or maybe calling CYF and letting them deal with it. 
 
I love my kids but I didn’t get to experience enough of my youth before I had them and they drain me to the point where all I do is plot on how to get away from my family. That’s not healthy and I’m not happy. Advice please

I cried all night every night until I was discharged and I just feel like any sort of happy moments or family experiences I should’ve felt looking at my baby were never there.

I’m tired of not loving my kid and being on all these meds that are supposed to help. I’m never listened to when I say they don’t help. I just keep getting told it’s a phase.

shortyr87,"I may not have ppd but I have been feeling so sad over the past few weeks. My first daughter is 10 weeks and I feel like she will grow up without any grandparents. To give some background, my husbands parents disowned him a week after she was born because we chose a Hindu name instead of a Bengali name for her. His dad emailed us a week after she was born with some harsh words, but basically saying I am an evil Muslim and not welcome in a Hindu family. We are both not affiliated with any religion and have never said we will be raising her as either Hindu or muslim. We have been together for 5 years and married for one year and they never once said they were not accepting of the fact i was born muslim. We have not told anyone but everyday I am sad for my husband. It was his birthday on aug 4 and my husband called them to make amends and they never bothered to call back. 

On my side my mom passed away 6 years ago and my dad remarried 2 years ago. They have seen my daughter twice. I asked my dad if he can look after her for 30 min on Monday so we can renew our mortgage and he said no they are not comfortable watching her. I then told him he is the only grandparent she has and he said he’ll try and convince my stepmom. They have not called to say we can bring her over and our conversation was 2 days ago. I don’t want to force him if he has no interest and I feel he has remarried and I am left over trash from his previous marriage of 34 years. My dad has family get togethers with his new wife and we are not invited. 

I feel like we have random friends who treat my daughter better than her own grandparents and it’s so hard to miss my own mom everyday and today I cried just holding my daughter when putting her to bed. Two sets of alive parents want nothing to do with her. It’s different if they were dead, but to be alive and doing this by choice. 

To top it off I have been so stressed breastfeeding and she is gaining weight slowly. I had a tough pregnancy and a tough delivery which ended up in an emergency c section. She had tongue tie which was only diagnosed at 6 weeks and she is still not gaining weight. My husband is great but it’s so hard when we need parents to help us too. We have done everything by ourselves and will continue to do so, but it is such a sad situation. Everyone has at least one parent to help. Or the parents are out of the city. My parents are in the city but my in laws are 3 hours away. Sometimes it would be nice just to talk to my mother in law and get her guidance. It is unfortunate they are missing so much of our daughters life. 

I feel so helpless and sad most of the time unless I am with my daughter. I just wish more than anything my mom was here because I know I would be able to ask her for anything.

aleague2017,"So last Sunday (July 26th) I gave birth to my daughter. (She’s the first child I’ve given birth to, I had a miscarriage previously and have a 12 year old step son) She came after 8hours of labor and under 30minutes or pushing. Completely unmedicated birth. (Not my plan, but that’s how it ended up going.) I was diagnosed with postpartum panic disorder the day after I was discharged from the hospital. 

I don’t think it sunk in that I was pregnant my entire pregnancy. It just never felt real. I went to my appointments and took care of myself but it never really felt real. I didn’t ever feel connected to her before she was born. I sung to her once because I felt like I should, but it felt really weird so I never did again. The first two days after she was born, my brain didn’t register that she was born. I took care of her but I didn’t register she was mine? It more felt like, “This is a newborn and newborns need taken care of so I will do that.” rather than acknowledging that she’s my newborn?? But then suddenly I went completely 180 and now at 6 days postpartum she’s the ONLY person I feel connected to. I don’t feel connected to my mom. I don’t feel connected to my step son. I look at my fiancé and I know logically I love them but I don’t really feel it anymore. They’re an amazing parent and have been doing so much for our daughter and I and I’m really glad we have them in our lives, but honestly they feel more like a really good friend than my fiancé. I don’t know what to do about it. We aren’t really physically affectionate anymore but I don’t know if that’s driving the way I’m feeling or if the way I’m feeling is causing me to be less physically affectionate or if it’s a vicious cycle.

BeautifulVictory22,"Hi new on here.... About to get completely real with you guys because I am absolutely tired of burdening my family. 
I have suffered with depression for quite a while and before I got pregnant things were looking up and I was doing really good. Then I got pregnant. 
Quick background: I am 24 currently and the Father of my son has been and on and off again relationship for about 10 years. I broke it off about 90% of the time. I think he did like 1 or 2 times. Don't know why I can't commit. And to be quite Frank never wanted to commit to anyone or anything. I do know I love him and he loves me but I feel my connection with anything is very fleeting

Back to story: 
We were not together when I got pregnant and he was actually planning on moving a couple hours away to finally cut completely ties with our relationship because it has been so toxic. Almost didn't tell him because I knew that's what he needed was to move and if I told him I was pregnant he would stay. But I ended up telling him and we tried to work it out romantically but didn't seem to work. Anyways, throughout the pregnancy I kept having thoughts of abortion or just killing myself. Normally it was abortion so that I felt better about killing myself. 
My son is born and he is full of so much love and purity that it completely overwhelms me. I try so hard to connect with this child of mine but just like my relationship with his father and everyone else in my life it is fleeting... 
His father started noticing me changing as he got to be about 1 years old and started needing me less, which when people don't ""need"" me that's when I start to slip further, so he started mentioning it to me and I honestly have completed numbed myself to feeling things or acknowledging my thoughts by being on social media or just watching comedic series on Netflix. One day after yet another conversation with someone where I felt like I failed, I had overwhelming thoughts of ending my life. Mind you the conversation was about me not letting the father of my son know that I was coming over to do laundry and so I ended up distracting him too much so he couldn't get to the gym before I had to go to work; overall that was not a very bad conversation, but still I felt so completely overwhelmed with thoughts of suicide. 
I open up to the father about it and he is shook and didn't even realize that, that is something I could be dealing with. I let him know I think I need inpatient care and I start looking. I make a couple calls and keeping hitting walls. My behavior starts to get worse and worse I am less and less engaged with my son and the father so the father tells me I need to get lawyer so we can get our arrangement settled so we can spend less time with each other and have our son on a schedule. I completely freak out in my mind. We talk I decide I want to go to the ER and hopefully they can get me to an Inpatient facility. 
5 days later I get out with no phone and very little TV time feeling all kinds of things that I haven't felt in so long... This was all about a week ago and ever since I have been in and out breaking down. I ended up telling the father that I need to leave and it hurt him so much but he ultimately is so understanding that I honestly feel as though I don't deserve it.
 
Anyways I left yesterday morning and last night spent the last part of the day sitting on the beach staring at the ocean dreaming of drowning in the ocean... I seriously cannot handle this life and the rollercoaster of emotions that I go through. I just want to feel peace again. I want to feel like I can connect with someone. 

Does anyone know of any place that I can go to get some serious help because this cycle feels never ending and I am hurting my family too much for me to bare.",Postpartum_Depression,Packed up my car and left,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/i1v8u4/packed_up_my_car_and_left/,1596325476.0,2020-08-01 16:44:36,
peonylove1031,"I never felt a connection with my second pregnancy. Wow, I have never openly admitted that. And I still don’t feel connected to my second born. Also something I have never admitted. I’m sad I even typed that. 

I’m now 4 months postpartum. I also have a 22 month old daughter- a ball of super high energy. My son (4 months) has bad reflux and colicky. I moved away from family to a new state. COVID killed my chance of making friends. Right now my husband is working 24/7 (like 60-70 hours a week). So here I am, in a new place, no family, no friends with 2 kids. I had baby blues with my first just because of the change. But my second. He is such a hard baby 😭 and I legit don’t know if I can handle it. He cries, I mean screams, all day. So I’m super frustrated. And then I’m like a shit mom cuz my daughter is on the back burner. 

Sleep? What’s that? My daughter fights sleep like I’ve never seen and she’s up most the night. Then it’s a back and forth between the kids all night long. One kid is up while the other is asleep. Then they are both up. I’m fighting them both back down, one falls asleep the other stays up. By the time I get that one to sleep the other is up. And I’m just like FUCK MY LIFE. 

I dread bedtime and I dread waking up for the next day. I don’t look forward to my days anymore. I’m so lonely. And when I talk to people al I get is advice! Like HELLO?! I’m not screaming for advice. I’m drowning. How about a hand to pull me out. A cry when I need one. A hug. Shit I’ll take a high five at this point. I’m so lonely. 

I started anti depressants a week ago along with anxiety pills. I’m hoping it uplifts me out of this dark hole I’m trapped in. I want to be a better mom. I don’t want to cry in a freezing cold shower just because I don’t give a shit, about anything. 

My husband is lovely. But he’s all like “be positive” that’s so much easier said then done. I’ve always been a positive person but I just can’t right now. I physically can’t even think one positive thought because I know I’ll get crushed as soon as I think it. Am I crazy?! I’ve completely lost it. 

Let me add, no way am I to the point of hurting myself or my kids. They are very much loved. I know I’ll get better and I know all my problems shall pass. But fuck, I’m so deep right now that I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.

WuzzyBubblu,"I’ve been having a hard time since my daughter was born. At 20 weeks they saw that she had a lump on her neck. They weren’t sure to what extent this would affect her so I was followed closely by the children’s hospital an hour away. As I got closer to my due date things looked good. She had a lump which they believed to be a lymphatic malformation buy her air way and lungs looked developed and open. They told me they would most likely take her to the NICU just to be monitored but they thought she would be fine. I felt a loss that I could not deliver naturally, could not do skin to skin, could not bring my baby right to the breast, could not delay cord clamping. There’s are all things I’ve always imagined happening at my birth. I’ve wanted a baby for a lot time but struggled with ovarian cysts. 
Literally 10 minutes before my scheduled c-section they came to tell me they’ve decided to intubated and sedate her just incase because the area around her lump could swell and cause her air way to be blocked. I argued that we should give her a chance and only intubated If there is sings of danger. They said it could be complicated to intubated after swelling happens. I ask if we could wait but sure intubated at the first sign of swelling, maybe she really didn’t need it. 
She came out screaming. A nice healthy loud cry. Definitely breathing. Within 5 minutes she was intubated and sedated and she stayed that way for 10 days. Because she was born on a Thursday and it took them a day to transfer her to the children’s hospital across the street from where I delivered. Then it was the weekend and the specialist weren’t around. They didn’t check her air way and clear it till the next Wednesday. Because they weren’t sure if her air way was affected no one could hold her in that time. The concerns I had were dismissed. I was worried about her getting addicted to the morphine and drugs she was on and was told babies don’t get addicted. Only to later be told she was psychically dependent on it. Guess that’s different to them. 
I couldn’t stay with her there and spent around 4000$ to stay in the area and be at the hospital everyday. I was totally checked out in order to deal with the stress and also felt completely invalidated as a mom. I felt like I had no autonomy at a parent. We were there for a whole week after she was off the meds and everything with them just monitoring her, no interventions.They made me prove I could take care of her before they would discharge her. They don’t do that to every mom. 
When I came home I questioned my self. I didn’t feel like I was able to take care of her. How do I know she’s okay if she didn’t have the monitors on her. They had me at the doctors 2-3 times a week for weight checks even tho she’s always been in the 40-50th percentile for weight. Making me feel even more incompetent. 
I just wanted someone to tell me “wow it seems that we created more problems then they’re need to be and that sucks” but all they could say was “don’t you want what’s safest for your kid”. 
I’m finally starting to feel some what better. I finally had the confidence to say I don’t like her doctors I’m looking for new ones and act on it. I feel much better with her new pediatrician who thinks her weight has been completely fine and looks to me for information on her health instead of assuming I don’t understand something. 
I’m talking to my own doctors. As you might know finding a new PCP and psych is a nightmare rn. But I’m doing it and I’m starting to feel okay. I still really want to have a day off and when I do get someone to watch her I realize I haven’t checked in on her. And wouldn’t a mom of a new born be worried and want to rush back? I don’t. And I feel bad about that stuff. But I also am recognizing that I’ve been through a lot and so much was out of my control. It’s going to take time to get back to normal. 
Just wanted to share with people who will understand. My family only point out that I haven’t been myself and comment that I should try to bond with her. They say well meaning but very unhelpful and sometimes hurtful things. I’ve been lurking and reading other peoples stories and relating so much to those feelings. I want to share that things will start getting better even if you feel like they won’t.

The first two weeks were rough (had to get a follow up surgery that extended the physical discomfort and healing process) but emotionally fine.

malscal,"I’m almost 11 months PP and I’ve finally allowed myself to come to terms with the fact that I have PPD and pretty severe PPA. The final straw was going to the ER because I truly thought I had an infection in my body that was spreading. I’d convinced myself of this. After a bunch of tests... everything totally fine. Except it wasn’t. 

No more thoughts of “this will go away naturally.” I’ve been telling myself that since he was born.

After 11 months, why do I still feel a struggle to get out of bed? How has it been 4 days since I last showered? Did I eat anything today? Why can’t I stop thinking about the next time I can have some alone time? Why do my breaks never seem long enough? Why am I so mad? Why do I feel myself subconsciously rejecting motherhood? Rejecting the “mom” identity? Am I not myself anymore? Does anyone care? 

On top of it all, no one knows how to talk to someone with depression and/or anxiety. 

- What do you have to be anxious about?
- I think you’re fine.
- Your baby loves you, he just wants to be by you.

No more. Maybe it’s just ignorance but these questions and statements only drive you further in the black hole and make you feel invalidated. I’m clawing my way out of that place starting today.

victoria-lisbeth,"When you asked how we were doing, I could have lied. I could have said it was all roses, and perfect, and the baby was great and we were great and why would it be any different? I could have given a bland, non committal answer. Oh, you know, usual baby stuff. Hell, I even could have told you to f*ck off and mind your own damn business. 

But I didn't  because my therapist has been encouraging me to be honest and share my struggles. Yes, I'm in therapy and taking meds, aren't you proud? Back on topic, I was honest. I shared that my baby was being incredibly fussy and crying more than usual. I shared what I thought it was. More importantly, I shared how my DH and I are struggling with it. The frustration in not being able to soothe him. The illogical certainty that he just hates us. The thoughts of just putting him down and walking away to sleep in the car to (hopefully please God) get some sleep. 

I told you how mom came over because I called her in tears and somehow choked out that I needed help (Therapist again) and it went against what every bone in my body was screaming: ""how weak to ask for help. It's not even been a full three weeks and you can't handle it already? Who decided that YOU should be a mom?""

Honestly wasn't expecting much from you. Maybe a that sucks and offer of help, or those empty platitudes people always give (""Its normal"", ""You'll get the hang of it""). I didn't expect you to give me the same advice over and over after I told you it didn't work. ""Gas drops every 3 hours with a feeding!"" I tried that. It didn't work. This did though. ""I'm telling you gas drops saved me with nephew!"" Great. Congrats. It isn't helping my baby.

And then you hit me with a series of dots and silence. Me, already feeling like absolute crap, immediately went to ""She's judging me. She doesn't think I'm a good mom either. She could take care of him way better than me."" After an hour of silence to my questions of what's wrong, you snap back with ""You don't have to keep brushing off advice when someone more experienced is trying to help you.""

First I was mortified, then I bawled (again, brain thinking yeah shes right) and now I'm just angrily tired. I didn't ask for your advice. I acknowledged it, said it didn't help and moved on. 

You know what though? Next time you ask how ya doing, I'm just going to ignore the sharing an and tell you to f*ck off instead if this is what sharing gets me.

grump_a_saurus,"I've had issues with mental health for about 12 years. The first few years were a big learning curve and it took about 4 or 5 to really get the help I needed. Since then, I pride myself on being self aware and always able to get the help I need before it becomes unmanageable. I see two therapists, one for general counseling and the other for PTSD. I see them each every other week so I meet with one counselor weekly. 

During pregnancy, my medication (lamictal) was not approved for use due to anxiety, only as a treatment for seizures which I do not have. So I had to get off of it. I tried meeting with a psychiatrist familiar with drugs and pregnancy but it took several months to schedule an appointment and I ended up having my baby early so they canceled the appointment. As soon as I was discharged I was put back on my medication but haven't felt any therapeutic effects from it yet. 

I've been watching my mood very closely for any changes. I'd honestly been feeling fantastic. I thought I had somehow managed to steer clear of PPD and PPA. Then all of a sudden, stressful, yet normal things would occur and I would be unable to calm down and would be excessively emotional. 

For instance, my short term disability check was finally approved on Thursday but for half the amount I was expecting. I totally lost it and had a full on meltdown. My baby spent her first 4 weeks in the NICU and I, mentally and emotionally, knew I could not go back to work after 6 weeks with only 2 of them having her home. I opted to take the full 12 weeks regardless of what they pay out. So when they chose to pay out half of the expected amount, I did not keep my cool. This I could understand and chose to give myself grace for the outburst. Anyone would have been upset. 

My next issue revolved around breastfeeding and pumping. I've had a low supply. The NICU situation made breastfeeding a challenge. I had been getting only 4 oz total a day for about 2 weeks. I purchased a Haakaa silicone pump and was able to double my supply in only 3 days with half the time it had been taking me to pump. I was thrilled, in less pain, and singing the Haakaa's praises far and wide. On day 4 I noticed a rash on my breasts and day 5 I was itching constantly head to toe. Went to the doctor, and low and behold, I am allergic to silicone. A very rare allergy. The allergy gets worse as you are exposed so that's why it didn't pop up immediately even though I'd been using a silicone nipple shield to breastfeed since week 2. But now I break out in hives when it touches my skin for a prolonged period. So I had to stop using the Haakaa, and I had to stop pumping and breastfeeding because of the hives on my actual nipples. Now my supply has dried up because I was hardly getting enough in the first place. So that led feelings of powerlessness and failure. Again, I was upset and disappointed, but it felt reasonable given the circumstances.

The most recent issue was my gift registry thank you notes. I became obsessive in getting them out. I worked tirelessly on them and wrote personal detailed notes and they were perfection. I had one or two I had questions on and when I asked my mom about them, I guess I was being imposing and she yelled at me and this sent me spiralling out of control. I have cried every waking hour since that phone call yesterday morning. I cannot calm down, the tears will not stop. No amount of logic is enough to stem the flow of tears. I have less patience with my child. I cannot handle multiple pressing tasks at once. I am overstimulated and completely overwhelmed. This is nothing I've ever experienced before. 

I recognize that this is very out of the norm for me so I scheduled an emergency OB appointment and the doctor diagnosed me with severe PPD and told me I needed another 6 weeks off work to allow for the medication to begin working. She prescribed zoloft on top of my lamictal. 

Part of me is so relieved for the diagnosis because my main stressor is money and I was planning to take the full 12 weeks anyway, but since PPD is a disability, now I can take the time off paid. So now I feel guilty that I feel relieved that I have a PPD diagnosis. 

Everything is off though. Nothing looks right or feels right and it's only been for about a week that things have really changed. It's nothing I've ever felt before and I thought I was a pro at knowing myself and my moods. This hit me like a ton of bricks and surprised me even though I was actively looking for it.

At night, it’s very hard for me to actually wake up to her crying (I actually incorporate them into my dreams sometimes 😭), and when I do, it seems to trigger me a lot. I get very anxious/frustrated/overwhelmed, and it’s becoming increasingly hard for me to respond to her at night, and it’s taking longer for me to be able to because I just seem to panic when she cries. I’ll literally cover my ears for a minute to have a minute of quiet before I respond. I’ll take a minute to walk away and calm down, and then not want to come back. 😔 I try to get my husband up so someone can tend to her, but I just feel horrible and like I’m going to cause psychological damage to my child.

I am not like this during the day; I normally get up and feel awful about it. I’m actually horrified that I’m having such a hard time at night and that sometimes she cries more because of it. I don’t know if it’s maybe my body reacting to the sleep deprivation? Or if I’m just a bad mom.

I feel like a different person, in arguments my husband has told me I’ve changed and even once that I have “issues” (boy this did not sit well let me tell ya)
I’m in a constant cycle of toxic arguments with my husband for at times feels like for no reason. I feel like the person I am most patient with is my baby, although there are nights where I want to cry because she won’t fall asleep, and I wish I could just press a button to turn her sleep mode “on” My irritation towards my partner and uncontrollable things in the world is off the charts. I hold grudges now—something I didn’t before and at night when I’m feeding the baby I’ll cry remembering all those shitty times we’ve argued. I’ve been told that most of the stuff that comes out of my mouth sounds negative..like a complaint or a problem and I don’t know how to change that. I’m afraid this will be permanently hurting my marriage. 

I feel like I’m slowly drifting away from the person I was, and also the lack of sleep does not help at all. On a good night I’ll sleep 3 hour spurts on a bad, 2. I’m not intimate with my husband, most of the times I have an aversion towards anyone that is not the baby. I’m too exhausted to be sexy, with the waking up at night, working from home, cooking and cleaning around the house I don’t have the mental or emotional  capacity to even consider any thing sexual. 

Recently I’ve been thinking if things would be better if I were to leave my husband, maybe that will make him happy, since he has expressed that he is not when we argue.

ariesbluenw,"I am in no way saying breastfeeding is wrong, so I hope I don't offend any mamas on here! I just have been thinking of this a lot recently and wanted to come on here and share my story as a new mom, because my experience with breastfeeding definitely contributed to my PPD.


My daughter is a little over 2 months old. She is a healthy 14 lbs .7 oz, she is always smiling, she is happy, she sleeps 6 hours at night, she is thriving. She barely ever fusses or cries. By the book she is perfect and I'm very blessed beyond belief. She is also strictly FORMULA FED. *gasp*

I still get looks of disdain from grown women, even doctors, when I tell them she is formula fed. My experience with breastfeeding was not fun. She had trouble latching, and even though we tried every position in the book, neither of us could get it to ""feel right"". 10 minutes in and we would both end up sweaty, frustrated, and in tears. Some of the lactation specialists that I saw in the hospital almost made me feel like supplementing with formula wasn't even an option I should consider. And every handout given to me only directed me towards breastfeeding. So when my infant was screaming in hunger, I was over ridden with guilt at the thought of formula feeding her. Constantly hearing ""It's 2020 and breast Is best."" I didn't even feel comfortable giving it a shot. But when I realized I can't starve my baby, I tried a combo of pumping AND supplementing... however, being chained to a milking machine just wasn't my jam. Sore nipples, fussing with machinery in the middle of the night, and let's be real - pumping bras can be a nightmare.

But here we are 2 months later and I'm here to let any curious new momma know, that FED IS BEST. If your baby is fed and thriving, and you are happy, please please please disregard any guilt you have about deciding not to breastfeed. And absolutely whatever reason you have for it, is VALID so long as your precious little babe is taken care of. Don't second guess your own mommy instincts like I did because ""the books say..."".

redirectibly,"I’m sitting here, furious w/my partner and breastfeeding for the thousandth time at 2am, and I haven’t seen a lick of sleep yet.

I’m so SO tired and done and just plain overwhelmed and I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I had a really traumatic birth/postpartum experience. I was in the hospital a week before she came, she was early and in the NICU and then I was separated from her and my husband and wasn’t allowed to see either of them. We finally got her home, and then I had a massive postpartum hemorrhage and had to go through all of that alone.

Cut to here, where I started BC and my milk supply has dropped and my 2 month old is frustrated and wanting to eat all the time, my husband just tore into me for having an attitude because I’m struggling with it. All while he can go back to sleep and ignore everything and doesn’t have to worry about making sure he’s making enough food to keep his daughter alive. That, and just the fact that he gets sleep at all just kind of makes me mad right now.

I’m just struggling so much. She doesn’t let me put her down during the day, so I can’t sleep when she sleeps. Then when my husband gets home, I’m cleaning because I can’t exist in a messy house.

I’m just TIRED and my anxiety is through the roof and I have so much rage and I’m so stressed and oh, I’m also completely alone because of COVID and we have no family that lives closer than 5 hours away. I don’t know what to do, but I’m miserable and I just need to get all of this out.

I would never hurt her or put her in a position to be hurt, but I don't feel motherly. I go through the motions of caring for her, doing what is necessary-feedings, bathings, clothing, shopping, but I wish I were doing anything else. I only want to go back to work to get away from her. And I think she senses it too. When I try to hold her, she pulls away like she knows I'm not right. I just want to run away and disappear most days. I go shopping a lot just to get away for a few hours. This pandemic isn't helping because I can't go anywhere for a release. I have limited interactions with people. I try to make her stay up as late as possible so she can wake up late in the mornings around 11-1130am so by the time my mom gets home around 12-1215pm that she is bathed and fed and she can deal with her. I don't have the strength mentally to deal with her. I'll put her in the playpen or playroom with her toys and only check on her to change or feed her.

I love him to pieces but also I can’t cope with him all the time. I feel really guilty constantly because I feel like I’m not taking care of him properly and I’m failing him as a mother. Because of this every time I’ve been out recently I’ve drank way too much like an idiot. It’s the only way I can seem to escape feeling so alone and helpless but then I always feel worse because I’m failing him even more by turning to alcohol. I feel like I’m spiralling and I have no idea what to do. Before baby alcohol was my main coping mechanism but now it can’t be yet I can’t seem to let go and find something else. It’s causing major problems in my life as I keep ruining my relationship with my partner. We now fight everyday and often in public around our friends.

Slippingbeavers,"I have the worlds most wonderfull son, he is a happy social 6 month old. He sleep through most nights,he loves his mama,he grows well and he meets his milestones.
But I dont get to enjoy it,im just slipping more and more into my PPD.

The relationship I have with my sons father, if it was not for my son I would have zero contact with him.
He has verbally abused me the entire pregnancy and up to this day, there is around three treaths a week that ""I need to watch it"" and ""there will be consequences"". 

He manipulates every single counselour we have met,he even managed to manipulate my friends and family, but they saw how he really is. He went on the whole entire pregnancy telling me that its not his son,he did not want anything with him,I could forget about child support and forcing my son to give a DNA test.
When I was 20 weeks pregnant I had the big ultrasound,there I got the choice to choose between my son or his father because all the stress was putting my son in danger. Up to this day,his dad still chews my ass for pulling me and my unborn son away so we could rest. Even then he would not stop.

He still makes things miserable,one day he wants his son the next he dont. He gets to see his son one hour a week ,I have offered more and he still says no just to complain that he gets too little. I dont understand him at all. Ive said my fair share of stupid things,but im trying to do better for my son so I only talk to his dad once a week to schedule the hourly visit.

Ive talked to cps,my sons doctor and a lawyer,there is nothing I can do. I talked to my shrink that I wanted to start antidepressants just to numb everything out.
I cant give my son the love he needs and deserves,somedays I get these fits where I dont even recognize my own son. The only positive thing is that I finally love my son,it sounds horrible but I have not been able to bond with him.

My son screams and cries when he sees his dad,he has zero connection to him. I try my best but I dont have any more in me. Ive become a shell, im so disconnected from it all. Some days I wish my son wasnt born because he deserves better.  I feel horrible,I feel like ive failed as a mother.

Horrible colic and hours of crying passed, only to bring to light the fact that I have the most miserable baby. It’s screaming and whining in my house all day. On top of it, everything is a struggle. Getting him to eat means 45 minutes of screaming and arching and slamming his head against the back of the high chair. Getting him to sleep means getting kicked, scratched, and bitten for over an hour first (and he needs to be held to nap). Diaper changes are screaming sessions until his face is purple. Getting him dressed is a temper tantrum followed by a complete meltdown. Taking him 10 minutes down the road in the car means him in the backseat, screaming until he’s physically sick. He won’t tolerate the baby carrier or the stroller. He doesn’t play, just pulls himself up and screams, throwing things. Oh, and waking up every two hours is a good night for us.

MammaSOEJ,"I am posting this to see if anyone else have had similar experiences after having their baby.  

About two years ago, my husband and I were discussing if we should have another baby or opt for permanent sterilization.  I was pretty much good with the three we already had and so was he, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I would be sad if we could never have another baby.  I did a lot of waffling back and forth whether we should try for another baby or go ahead with him getting a vasectomy.  What we finally agreed on was that we would try for the rest of the year (it was about August or so if I remember right) and if we didn't get pregnant, we would call it quits.  I got pregnant soon after.  I remember feeling nothing for this baby.  I was so excited when I learned I was pregnant with all my other kids that I felt guilty about not feeling anything about this one.  I knew I was pregnant early on (about 4 weeks along) because I started to get nauseous.  I put off making any prenatal appointments because I figured I've done this before - there's not much the doctor is going to say/do that would surprise me.  I finally saw the doctor and saw the baby in January.  I still felt nothing.  A part of me didn't want to go through pregnancy and having a little one totally dependent on me again.  And I think I regretted a bit about conceiving her.  Happily, I finally started to fall in love with my child.  It happened so much later in the pregnancy - about half way through - but I was so glad I was starting to warm up to the idea of being a new mom again.  Baby girl was born in July.  This is where things get weird.

A few nights after we came home, I was sitting in her room rocking her when I heard footsteps in the hallway.  It sounded like someone was walking down the hall.  These were not the usual house noises, these were footsteps.  After I put baby to bed, I checked on the kids' room (they all sleep in the same room) and the door was firmly closed, nobody was in the bathroom.  I asked my husband if he had gotten up.  He said no.  That was a little hard to explain to myself but maybe it was because I was too tired.  A few days later, baby and I were alone in the house (hubby was trying to keep the older kids busy so I could have some alone time).  I was in the living room reading when I heard a crash in the kitchen.  I got up to check it out but didn't see anything that could have fallen.  I even checked to see where the cat was in case she was the culprit - she was curled up sleeping.  Weird, but maybe something fell and I just couldn't find it.  Another night and baby can't sleep.  She keeps crying so I'm out in the living room so we don't disturb my husband who has to work the next day.  The lights are on low and I'm sitting reading again (btw, Kindle unlimited was my bff the first 3 months after having baby) and I heard a ball bouncing.  My mother-in-law had gotten them those big bouncy balls with a handle that they can sit on and bounce around the house.  Two of them were next to the sofa.  I looked over and they're just sitting there.  I heard one bouncing though.  I wonder if the air vent would have been able to push one away ... but how would it have been able to make it bounce?  Then I thought maybe we have mice and one happened to brush by one of the balls.  We keep the cat in the basement at night so I know it wasn't her.  I chalked it up to being tired again (though I've never had anything like that happen before).  Anywho a few more days pass.  My husband takes the kids to a football game across the street and it's just me and baby again.  She had just fallen asleep so I put her down and watched some youtube videos.  I have my headphones on - slightly askew so I can hear baby if she cries.  Suddenly I hear a little girl's voice.  I know for sure it wasn't through youtube, and though I didn't catch most of what the little girl was saying, I did catch my daughter's name. (Yes, she was talking about my daughter!)

wrongfrench,"First off, I’m so in love with my baby girl, but starting with a hellacious traumatic 56 hour labor with 2 failed epidurals, it seems nothing is going right. We got her home after a few extra days in the hospital, and started to adjust to our new normal.. first few days went ok until we found out her weight had dropped tremendously thanks to flat nipples and a bad latch. No worries, I could pump and supplement with a bottle of my own milk and she was starting to get the hang of the nipple shield. My partner and I have been at odds with one another thanks to no support (thanks covid) and no sleep. We often end up cussing each other out at 3 am over some dumb thing. Fast forward a few weeks and cluster feeding starts, this I thought must be the worst thing we would have to endure, she wouldn’t sleep and just wanted to be on a boob every 30 mins for 3-6-12 hours. Then it passes after a few days, ah finally she’s sleeping for 2-3 hours between feeds. Then a few days ago I woke up at 4am with every single joint in screaming pain and shivering plus a serious headache. I thought I must have the flu, next day my boob is fire hot and red and hard. Urgent care says yep, mastitis here’s some antibiotics (my 5th in 3 weeks thanks to group B strep, chorioamnitis developed in labor, then a uti right after I got home). Still haven’t gotten relief from the mastitis yet but the last 24 hours it seems baby girl has developed colic symptoms likely from drinking milk with antibiotics in it. I’ve reached a level of self loathing that my partner can’t really handle, I’m sobbing all the time and really wondering why I thought I could handle being a mom. I know that it’s not my fault but I just hate feeling like I cant give her what she needs over and over again, I hate letting her down already at just 3 weeks old. Phew.

beingsmomishard,"This is hard for me to put into words but I am struggling to know if how I feel is normal

My son is 11 months old now and I don’t think I have enough of the symptoms to really think I have ppd and probably this entire lock down quarantining is just exacerbating my feelings but everything just feels so hard

I love my son so much but I really struggle to feel like I am enough. My husband and I are constantly arguing usually due to how he doesn’t realize how the things he says make me feel. I work full time from home and throughout the quarantine he has taken on the role of the nanny/stay at home Dad. Once I am done work for the day my son is usually napping and so I start with his dinner and breastfeed and play with him when he wakes up, I feed him his dinner and if the weather is nice my husband takes him out for a walk for 45 minutes usually. And I am so exhausted at the end of the day. Then my husband will sometimes complain that I don’t do “anything”. If the kitchen is a mess after I’ve made dinner and I don’t clean it he will tell me that I have no respect for him and he has even told me that he’s spoken to his mother and brother and friends and they all agree I should be doing more. But sometime, really a lot of the time I just don’t feel like I can. I know it’s not fair to leave the mess for him but I also know he isn’t working and so it feels sort of fair to en that he handles the cleaning. For the first time since he has started eating solids a few days ago I felt so sick with a headache and just dizzy that I couldn’t handle giving him his dinner so I asked him to do it. And I broke down crying after because I just felt so guilty that I didn’t take care of him and that I let him do the job that has always been my responsibility. 

Some days I just wake up dreading having to do anything, not wanting to have to take care of my son because he is so much work and has been so cranky and I feel so so guilty like I am a terrible mother because I just want a break.

postpartumpoopoo,"So I'm 2 weeks away from returning from maternity leave to the workplace. They have permitted me to WFH. 

My partner works on an ""on-call"" basis and my original childcare was meant to be a 70 year old woman so that's fallen through. So I've had a huge battle with work to be flexible with my shifts but also to try and maintain my pay because they refuse to apply for furlough. 

It's been a war. It's involved the union and on top of my already miserable days struggling with PPD I've got work related stress and anxiety. 

Finally, my union rep and the head of our business sector came up with a solution that was highly beneficial to me. I'd work 7 days a week (fine), 6.30pm-10pm which made up most of my contracted hours, and the rest of my contracted hours would be ""special paid leave"".

Amazing, I thought. 

My kid is almost 12 months old, and we made the decision to continue breastfeeding as allergies have come to light with recent weaning meaning food is limited, especially seen as shops are usually bare by the time we get there. There's also almost never any formula and I'd hate to buy it when my breasts do produce milk when there are mothers struggling to get it and might have no supply, triplets and might just be worse off than I am right now. We also cannot for love nor money get any whole milk. There's a fuck tonne of semi skimmed or skimmed milk, but no whole and 12 month olds need whole milk. 

I also can't get along with a pump. I'm a part time breastfeeding peer support volunteer, I am highly trained, I can help with almost all breastfeeding issues and the irony is that pumping just has never really worked for me. I suspect it's something to do with the PPD, lack of oxytocin being produced while pumping etc etc, but for that reason I can only really get my baby to take milk directly from the breast.

So imagine my joy when all of my worries about how my child is going to stay sustained fell through when my manager said they refuse to acknowledge paid special leave, that they'll ad-hoc my shifts but also told me that I can't have any distractions including from children because it's a customer facing role. 

I have gone back to my union but it's like shoveling shit in a farmyard. It just doesn't stop. This stress is relentless and I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. I spend all day crying, then getting super motivated to fight this, then cry some more and realise there's not much I can do to win here. 

If I decide to just quit, I have to pay back my company maternity pay which has been spent. Long gone. I have no money to give back, and the thought of fighting that battle just scares me more. 

I asked my union to just push for furlough on the grounds of needing childcare and she said that if I were furloughed, which my workplace have already refused to do, that I'd lose my ""death-in-service"" benefits for my family. She said that as I'm overweight and in a vulnerable category that it wasn't sensible to push for furlough. That just made me even more scared. 

Honestly all of this is just getting to me.",Postpartum_Depression,I think my workplace are going to be the end of me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/g4c4hl/i_think_my_workplace_are_going_to_be_the_end_of_me/,1587344261.0,2020-04-19 17:57:41,

The Price We May Pay

&amp;#x200B;

You don’t know what you’re asking of me—  
what it was like for me, when 2 became 3.

&amp;#x200B;

When I became a shadow that hated itself.  
My black-hued, opaque face — spiritless,  
unable to display or exude  
the proper amounts of joy and gratitude  
expected to accompany the miracle of life.

&amp;#x200B;

I slowly shrank into myself,  
everyday as the sun rose high in the sky,  
leaving me withered, parched and sucked dry.  
A sliver of darkness underfoot,  
wondering if today I wouldn’t survive,  
wouldn’t magically reappear as the sun sunk low.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I’m better now….

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It’s been a few years….

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But…

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You’ve been urging for 3 to become 4  
and I don’t know if I can handle any more.  
What if even the shadow disappears?  
Gone for good at high noon one day…

danihaydu,"I want to start out by saying how much I love my son. I’m crying as I type this because I think of his blonde hair, his piercing blue eyes and his gorgeous smile. He is my best friend.

I am currently laying in bed, I have been crying all morning. I was helping my boyfriend measure our crib this morning.. I set my son down on the bed and looked away. As I looked back, he was falling off the bed, in slow motion. I couldn’t believe my eyes, I screamed and ran. I couldn’t face the fact I had let my baby fall off the bed. I ran upstairs, broke down on the floor and began to sob. My boyfriend came up the stairs with my son, and I grabbed a cup full of coffee and smashed it on the ground while saying how I can’t do this anymore. In that moment I just wanted to die. 

I lost my mom a year and a half ago to suicide. I miss her more than words can even describe. I feel like my life is becoming slowly more empty as my son gets older because I don’t have my moms guidance. I feel like I am slowly breaking down. 

I hear phantom screams when I’m in the shower, I turn the nozzle off to make sure I’m just dreaming. I shoot awake at night to check my son hasn’t died. I obsess over checking on my son during naps to make sure he’s breathing. I mush his food into paste to make sure he isn’t going to choke and die. I have dreams of my boyfriend carrying him down the stairs, tripping and accidentally killing my son. 

I’m breaking down.

I sometimes wonder if my moms path will be mine. I’m sick of seeing moms on social media make it look so easy, it’s hard, it’s draining and it’s slowly eating away at me.

j_grantham94,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a FTM to a 2 month old baby girl. Recently, I've figured out that I have PPD. I don't think it was too bad upfront, but the virus and lock down really haven't helped. It's so hard to do things I enjoy, as most things I like doing are shut down. 

Anyway, I've noticed lately that it's really hard for me to enjoy my husband in a physical way. I still find him attractive, he has been incredibly supportive, he helps take care of the baby, he does things around the house, he is still working, so overall, he is amazing. However, I just can't find myself wanting to have sex with him. It's not just that, I have no interest in sex at all. I almost feel like my brain is telling me I'd be a bad mom if I have sex.. which doesn't make sense, but ya know, depression....

I talked to my husband a little bit about this and explained how I just don't feel good about myself as my body has changed so much. I also explained that I want to take things slow since I'm still healing and sex still hurts. 

I just don't want to scare myself into thinking this will last forever and put off having sex with my husband forever. I just want to get back to my old self, and I just don't know what steps to take?

postpartumpoopoo,"I'm coming to the end of my 12 month maternity leave and the loss of freedom has been a struggle. 

There have been days we've been on the sofa, with nursery rhymes on repeat, while my baby naps and if I try to set them down they just crawl back on up. 

There are days where I can't even catch a break to get a drink and I end up with dehydration headaches than painkillers just don't quell. 

My partner is currently WFH, (as will I, soon) and he can see I'm absolutely fried on his breaks. I can't get away from my baby, and I just want him to come and take this kid off me for 5 minutes but he goes to the bathroom and gets a drink and I sit there growing resentment that I wish I could do those things. 

I'd usually leave my son to cry for 5 minutes every so often while I looked after myself but now my partner is working from home and talking to customers I can't do that. 

In some ways my partner's life has changed but he doesn't understand that I feel trapped. I've tried telling him I feel trapped and his responses were:

* You can go for a walk if you want
*You can do the weekly shop this week if you'd like
* Hop in the bath, but don't be too long. 

I don't enjoy going for walks, I don't enjoy doing the food shop, I don't want to sit in a bath that I'm not even afforded the time to enjoy. A bath isn't a hobby, but I've not had my own time for so long that I just don't even know what I enjoy doing any more. 

I've had a lot of stress about work, and them enabling me to work from home because there's no childcare available to me. It involved the union and to be honest it's still not resolved, which has left me worrying about money too as well as fighting for my right to keep my family safe which means MORE isolation. 

I honestly feel like I'm missing this huge part of my personality but I can't remember what it was like to try and get it back.

I wish I could have some kind of lobotomy so I could just crack on with it without feeling all of these feelings. I just want to wake up without despairing about the groundhog day that is Infront of me for the foreseeable future.

He hasn’t been affectionate at all towards me. He has been towards her which I am grateful for and I think he will be a great dad no matter what happens with us. I know hormones and whatnot but I feel like I just know it’s done between us.

throwaway_ppd1,"Our daughter is 7 months old. My wife has a history of depression before pregnancy and after our baby arrived it came back in force.

She has been going to therapy and has seen a psychiatrist for medication.

 I am at work most of the day and she is at home. We also live at my mother in laws house. A usual day I will get up for work before both are awake and kiss them goodbye.

DD usually wakes up around 8am, and my wife will sometimes get up and take care of her but most of the time she texts her mom to come get the baby and she goes back sleep.

On good days she will get up around 10 or 11 and hang out with grandma and baby. Grandma does a lot of the feedings, diapers, and keeping little one entertained.

On bad days she won't get out of bed until afternoon, sometimes she has been in bed when I get home around 4pm.

When I get home I play with daughter, feed her, change her when she needs it. Around 8 or 9 I put her to bed. Then wife and I hang out then go to sleep. 

I don't know how to help my wife, she doesn't want to do much with daughter. She loves her and likes to hold her when she sleeps and when she does play with her it breaks my heart seeing the two of them so happy because I wish it was always like that.

Teacher_Shark,"Little one is three weeks old today and while I love her to pieces, I sometimes don't feel a bond with her. Sometimes I look at her and my heart melts or she'll cry and I just have a surging need to go to her and love her and care for her. Other times, I feel so distant and detached from her and have no desire to interact. I don't cry alot, mostly because I won't let myself, but I nearly constantly feel like I could cry. I feel like I'm failing as a mom. Last night the idea popped into my head that she would be just fine if I left her with her father and just disappeared. I haven't had thoughts of hurting myself or her, just that she and my husband would be better off without me in the picture.

I think some of this stems from the fact my husband practically had to raise his two nephews in high school and already knows how to take care of our daughter. And I don't think he means to, but sometimes he comes off as annoyed when I struggle with doing something or don't know how to do something for her. This doesn't help with the whole ""failing as a mom"" thing. 

He also kept telling me and my family that we were holding her too much and would spoil her, practically from the time she was born. My parents of course ignored him, but I struggle to do that and listened to him. I now feel like I missed out on crucial bonding time in the first week or so by only holding her when feeding her or if she was actively crying. Now I rarely want to just sit and hold her, and I barely got the experience of just sitting, holding, and staring lovingly at this little human I made. This makes me even sadder.

throwawayf0rreasons3,"Trigger warning: rape, suicide, and abuse mentions.


So when i had become pregnant with my daughter it was from being raped by my boyfriend at the time. He was abusive and raping me was one of his ways of hurting me. I had become pregnant before from this, but miscarried very early. I had planned on getting an abortion or putting my kid for adoption after she was born, but my mom (been my main abuser since i was a baby) threatened to kill me if i did those things. I had left my ex (even though he was stalking me) and had to move back in with my parents. I was 19 with no college experience and little work history (i had planned to get away from my abusive family and going to college then). I wasn't ready, and even though being abused almost daily and my life constantly being on the line is not a good excuse to bring a child into that life I did. 
My daughter was born and i had alot of mixed feelings. I loved her, but i was also so very scared (ex showed up at the hospital. I kept the where and when secret and only told close friends, yet he showed up). I usually became agitated when my daughter cried. My family became more abusive towards me and included my daughter in it ( throwing me around the house, locking me in the garage if i tried to leave the house with my daughter, screaming at my daughter, neglecting her if i was working till id come home to her with a bloody rash because they wanted me to quit my job. After i quit it got worse to the point where they stole all my savings and would withhold money and formula if my kid needed it. Would eat all our food to starve us,trying to give my infant daughter beer cause they thought it was funny. and i was the only one cleaning and being beaten if there was a mess. Just alot of abuse) then with my ex still stalking me trying to get me alone. I became very depressed and thought things would be better if me and my daughter died. It was that mentality while trying to find work,working for like 3 weeks, then quitting because i couldn't afford buying food for my daughter (that my family would either eat or throw away) and a proper daycare while trying to find a lawyer cause my family forged some papers to take him to court for child support. (They filled it out in my name and then threatened our lives if i didn't take him to court)..... We got out of my parents house after my daughter turned 1 but a year after that i got kicked out of my home and moved back in with my dad (parents had divorced) we shared a room with my little brother and his girl friend. My daughter had a play pen to sleep in and i had an air mattress that later turned into a broken futon. My brother and his girlfriend eventually purposefully broke my daughter's playpen and had their new cats pee and spray in it. I had to throw it away. Then i moved in with my mom cause the abuse wouldn't stop. It got worse there. She brought my ex over and left him,me, and my daughter alone. He waited till my daughter fell asleep and then tried to assault me in the same room. I pushed him off me and he left....

I would be lying if i didn't say that i attempted suicide a lot. My last attempt was last year in may. Its been over a year since ive lived with my family. And looking back at my emotions i was not in a healthy place and was very selfish to put my daughter through that with me.  Things aren't perfect yet. I tried to put my daughter up for adoption so i could give her a chance at a better life, but my ex took me to court. 
So our situation currently is... Ive left my family, cut my mother out of my life and only let my family on when i want them (i don't let myself be their door mat.)  I lost my job because of the Covid-19, but im also applying for college to get in in august or even January. I go to therapy and parenting classes and i have my daughter in therapy as well. My ex is sadly apart of our lives and he wont 3 days of being alone with my daughter. (So she is stuck alone with my rapist for 3 days) legally cant do anything unless my ex rapes me again in front of my daughter or he hurts her.( my lawyer told me this) but i have always taught her agency and that it is not okay for someone to invade her space and that when she says no to anything it means no. People need to ask her before they hug her and she has a choice to say no. Also that it os not okay for someone to touch her privates unless its to help her wash,get dressed, or go potty. And only mommy and her teacher with getting dressed.

Basically i found that alot of my PPD was because i was in an abusive environment and had a very bad past to where i don't know what a mothers love is nor how to be a loving parent.. Im in therapy now and it helps bundles. Things are not perfect now, but one step at a time we are getting there. 
Alot of my ppd was my fear of failing her and letting her grow up as i had. And though ive failed her now and then im doing my best to keep her safe and i wont let her ever go through what i had. I will never let her be hurt by them again. 
I'm sorry that this is a mess and a big jumble of words, but i needed to vent and reassure myself and maybe hope that im not alone on the ""fear of failing"" thing.

Why am I crying? Why do I wish I never had him? I feel so stuck. I wasn't able to go back to work like I expected because of the virus and now I'm stuck at home with my almost 3 month old and it's driving me crazy. He hasn't been sleeping in his crib because everytime I put him down he wakes up 5 minutes later and I can't handle it anymore. He sleeps all night when he's on the bed with us but I'm still waking up frequently and I'm exhausted. During the day he only naps if I stay in bed with him. I don't know how he knows when I'm not in the room but he does, and he cries everytime. I only get to eat once a day (when my SO gets home from work) because I have no time for myself. It's hard to even go to the bathroom because I know that he'll wake up crying. When I do have some time, I have no motivation to make food or to shower or even to pee. I just sit on the couch and think about how crappy I feel until I hear him wake up again. I can't handle it anymore. I can't handle being alone with him, I hate it so much. But I feel like I can't ask for help anymore because anyone can have the virus and I don't want to risk his health just because I feel weak. I feel so guilty for feeling this way, I always thought I wanted to be a mom, and now that I am I just want to leave everything behind and pretend this never happened. I hate feeling this way.

TruthHurts17,"Not all the time. Some are just not getting the support they need. More to come, on this topic. I welcome your thoughts, respectfully. My initial ideas on problems that contribute to postpartum depression are...
1. There are still businesses that do not give fathers/partners paid time off after a new baby. This is when new moms need the MOST support. 
2. Social constructs play a huge in role in making it difficult for couples to have/raise kids in general. Both parents can rarely stay home. Someone has to bring in money and someone has to watch the kids. Both parents can work but they would need to bring in enough money to pay for someone else to care for the children for, probably, most of one paycheck. Unless you’re super rich. Then never mind. 
3. Many social media and TV/movie moms make it look so easy. But it’s not. It’s really hard to be a mother. But nobody really sees that very much and so a lot of fathers/partners just assume that it’s all going to be fine. But when it’s not, It’s a huge disappointment for everyone.

I had a really difficult transition into Motherhood including Postpartum Depression. My experience was so terrible to the point I was extremely suicidal. I feel like I did so much preparation for the pregnancy and labor, but spent no time preparing for what comes after. I thought a postpartum doula would be unnecessary and only hired a labor doula. I also didn't set any boundaries and allowed visitors right away. I hated being a mom. I didn't bond with my baby right away. I felt guilty, selfish, and extremely lost. It took a lot of soul work, therapy, tapping back into my spirituality, and time to get better. I just look back and think like Wow there was so much I didn't know and so many things I wish I could do differently. I have dedicated my life now to help other women who are going through what I did.  


I don't necessarily have any programs up yet, but I vision having a Postpartum Coaching business or online program soon. I am conducting this survey to see what mothers really are seekings for to create the best possible program for them. I just really believe that there is such a need to help mothers transition into motherhood.

If you feel called to please help me by taking this survey. Thank you so much. It really means so much to me and is my life's calling.

hippogiraffemus,"I messaged my OB yesterday about medication options for PPD/PPA since I’m 11 weeks postpartum and have not been feeling myself, and coronavirus has made it worse (can’t even get out to mom-baby groups where I am right now).

She prescribed 50 mg Zoloft.  I took the first dose around noon today and shortly after felt  very dizzy and groggy.  Problem is— I’m on mat leave and the caretaker for my son during the day, so these side effects freaked me out because caring for a newborn when drowsy is unbelievably hard (on top of the sleep deprivation I’ve already got).  Thank goodness my dad was here to entertain my son so I could lay down for a few minutes, but he leaves tomorrow.  I understand the side effects are temporary but that still doesn’t make it any easier.

OB recommended trying 25 mg first, and I might try the dose at night.

aclovington,"Does anyone else experience this? Prior to pregnancy, I had been working through GAD and cPTSD so I started seeing a therapist again prior to delivering my DD. I do have PPA and my OB increased my sertraline dosage. I'm also continuing with my therapist. I am trying everything. Journaling, reading, relaxing, talking, etc. 

However, I feel like such a burden to my husband. Like any time I experience any sense of anxious energy, he is very frustrated with me and I start to feel even crazier. Like maybe I'm a burden. I didn't start feeling depressed until the last couple of months bc I feel emotionally I don't have much space to express my emotions in my personal life (outside of therapy) without any kind of repercussions with him. 

Suddenly it's that as though I don't handle things well but I rarely show much emotion at all around him because I fear he thinks I'm a head case if I even cry. Like today I cried for the first time about how quickly my daughter is growing bc she's 6 months today and me just crying caused him to lose his patience with me. I tried to explain why it was tough to process. I just feel like I have such little room for err. I would be better off an emotionless robot or just if I was gone altogether and no longer a burden.

1 year later my wife is back at work and I am staying home during the days to look after children and working from home. 

During the 1st year I could not do anything right and was constantly berated and questioned about almost everything I do, to a total lack of any physical affection (sex, hugs, kisses) or even saying I love you or good bye when she goes somewhere.

alyssakarina,"I believe I’m struggling with PPD/A. I’m only 2 weeks postpartum and decided to go see my doctor already because I noticed myself not having any sort of feeling anymore. 
I don’t want to get out of bed, I don’t want to get ready, I don’t want to help out around the house, and worst of all, some days I don’t want to help my boyfriend with our newborn son and that absolutely kills me. 
My doctor put me back on birth control to attempt to regulate my hormones since it is too early to diagnose PPD &amp; administer medication in my case. So far, I don’t feel any difference. In fact, I just want to cry most days because of the thoughts and feelings I have. I love my newborn son to death but I feel completely incapable of taking care of him and feel as if I already need distance from him. 
I’m thankful because my boyfriend is 100% supportive of me and taking care of our family. I brought up the fact that I think it might be best to have a family member take our son 3-4 days out of the week and stay with them overnight while I can work on getting better for myself and for my little family.

ladysadi,"My baby is 9 days old today. I never found out the gender because I was so terrified of having a boy that I thought going through the pregnancy ignorant of the gender would allow me time to get attached and not care by the time delivery came along. 
Baby came in an unexpected way and I ended up with induction and c-section. Both of which were top of my list of fears. Thankfully I got my healthy baby girl and she's absolutely beautiful! In the beginning when I was in the hospital I felt like I was mostly normal mood wise. A day or so after arriving home the depression kicked in. It's still early so I'm not sure if this is true PPD or baby blues. It's intense though.
My husband has been amazing. He knows none of this is my fault and he's been as available as possible when I need to just talk even if he's heard it all before. My mom is also here but she's one of those ""mind over matter"" people despite being a nurse who should know better than to tell someone with depression to just be strong.
It's hard for me to be in the quiet. I can't look at the baby book, some of the decorations I spent hours making for her room, the playlist of Disney lullabies I used to listen to when I was pregnant, and sometimes even looking at the photos from the hospital. That all makes me cry. It feels like I'm mourning her growing up before it's ever happened. I miss being pregnant and having her with me all the time. I'm so in love with her and my husband. I feel like I can't get close enough or spend enough time with either of them. I feel like that part is normal. But is it normal to miss the newborn days before they are gone? Remembering things isn't the same as experiencing them. I'm exhausted and frustrated with breastfeeding and lack of sleep. I'm a little ashamed I ended up being the first in the family to get a C-section. But those are nothing compared to what I just described.

Obscuremuir,"Hi I'm new here! 
 I'm two months post partum and yesterday I was diagnosed with PPD with previous diagnosed depression and anxiety. We pretty much knew as soon as I got pregnant that PPD was going to be a thing. I was severely depressed my entire pregnancy, bad thoughts, you name it. 
I wanted to be as preventative as I could. I went to counseling before I gave birth and put my name on a list for PPD care/services. I've done exercising, vitamin upping, vitamin D, sunshine etc but I suppose it wasn't good enough. I'm by no means the worst of the worst but I scored very high on my PPD test and the nurse was very worried.
When my son cries sometimes I just hold him and zone out. My husband noticed this the other day, weirded him out. It was like I shut off.
I feel like I failed my husband and son because I should have prevented it, but how do you prevent a mental I? 
I'm relieved that I have an explanation so now I can do something about it. 
One of the more difficult things is, I'm so stressed out about everything I want a smoke. I quit for almost a year but I still want them.

The first few months were just terrible. I felt like I made the worst decision in my life, I wanted her dead etc. while I never personally wanted to harm her ever, I many times thought I’d be ok if she just didn’t wake up.

brokenchalkboard,"Hi all, I'm new here. I'm always on reddit but never thought about looking for a PPD subreddit? Despite being in like 4 other mental health related subreddits? Idk 

So I'll be brief. I'm 22 and my fiance and I knew we both wanted kids, and when our son came into existence, we were pretty over the moon. I have had an extensive history of mental health problems due to trauma, abuse, death, ect. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 11 and then Borderline personality disorder at 19. Which fucking sucks by the way, it's so insanely stigmatized and I'm terrified ever telling anyone I have it because the world views us as monsters. (Yes, I can acknowledge that  people with BPD can cause destruction and harm, though it isn't exclusive to us despite it being prominent. Mostly we don't intend on what we do and are filled with so many raw emotions and pain. I'm not saying this to negate an experience with BPD, but perspective? Idk)

I'm a quieter person with BPD. teen years were hard but as adulthood has come around, I've mellowed out and found great success with doing solo DBT. 

But oh fuck. Once I had my baby, my entire mental health was just.... thrown out the window. 

The biggest thing was paranoia. I didn't want to talk to anyone because I thought they would take my baby from me and that I would be deemed an unfit parent. So I just said I was sad at check ups, but didn't divulge more. I am constantly followed by what feels like dread, guilt, hatred, anger, sadness, regret and intrusive thoughts. The intrusive thoughts were about hurting my baby and it was so fucking scary. He would just yell and yell and it's like there was a battle going on in my head between two people. ""Throw him."" ""He's a fucking baby! I can't throw him!"" ""Se him down and go slit your wrists, then. You're a shitty Mom""

I've relapsed with an unspecified eating disorder too. That makes it so much harder. I dropped 13lbs last month and just can't force myself to eat, because if it isn't ""safe"", then I purge it. It's stupid. 

So the headline. I was at my baby's 4 month appointment and I was already feeling insanely anxious for some reason. They asked me how I was doing and I was honest and told them. I started to cry if they asked me if I had thoughts of hurting him. I told them yes, but they're not something I would ever act on, or welcome, or entertain. I was so scared. I was just sobbing and clutching him, begging them to not take him away. 

They quickly reassured me they wouldn't take him away, just that they're concerned for me. I'm being weaned off of 40mg of prozac and trying paxadil next. I haven't been successful with other depression/anxiety meds. 

I feel so lost and scared. I so badly want to be his Momma, I so badly want him to grow up with fond memories, I so badly don't want to fucking feel this way. I'm only happy when I'm cuddling him, and despite that being a good thing, I want to feel alive in other aspects of my life. 

It's scary, lonely, isolating. I've thought about calling crisis lines many times and going to inpatient. I don't know what to do at this point. Last week I took a turn for the worst and had 5 anxiety attacks after not having them for a couple of years. It just sucks and I guess this is me venting.

And not so great for those of us with hormonal issues. My past rant was about how noone offers progesterone shots in my state. Noone in my state will even test my hormones postpartum.

pubeastank,"I’m 24 f and I had my first child in December. She’s 2 months old now and the first month was relatively easy, but once she hit one month things went downhill very quickly. The more time progresses the less I feel like myself. I have PTSD so I’m not a stranger to serious depression and anxiety. So when I found out I was pregnant unexpectedly the first thought I had was PPD. Well a week ago I was officially diagnosed with it and I just feel like an absolute failure. I had a job for 5 years in a daycare before she was born but my boyfriend and I agreed it would be best for me to be a stay at home mom and take care of her myself. I’ve recently been questioning if that was the right choice. 
My daughter is not an easy baby. She cries for absolutely no reason all the time. When she cries it sets my anxiety off ten fold. It’s like nails on a chalkboard. It gets so bad I have to put her down and just walk outside and use my vape, because of this I worry she will be behind because she HATES tummy time and I mentally cannot stand to listen to her cry. I have to hold her all the time so I feel like I’m holding her back physically because I just can’t set her down without losing my mind. 
My boyfriends shifts are all over the place and some days he works until 11 and comes home tired to both me and the baby crying which just makes me feel 12 times worse because he already works all day and I have to rely on him so much when he comes home and wants to relax. He’s really supportive and he’s never made me feel bad but I just feel terrible about how much he worries about me. He’s also on occasion treated me like I might snap one day and harm the baby and that’s furthest from the truth. Now it’s getting worse because where I used to be able to sleep easily when she’s asleep now I’m laying awake at night thinking about how awful I am and how my baby and her father would be better off if I just didn’t exist in their lives. I know I’m probably going to need to end up on medication so I’m not a risk to myself, but I’m scared of the trial and error that comes with it. I’ve had bad experiences with medications in the past. 
I just feel so absolutely lost and sad. I have no energy to do any of the things it seems all of the moms I know can do, taking care of their houses and themselves. My house is a mess, I barely find the time to take care of myself which doesn’t help the fact that I feel squishy, fat and gross 90% of the time. And Most of the time I feel so disconnected from my daughter and that breaks my heart because I love her and I think she deserves so much better than me. 
The worst part of it all is 2018 I worked so hard on my own and with my therapist to get to a point where I could actually say I loved myself and felt comfortable in my skin, and it’s all out the window now. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I just want to disappear.

Medium_We1l,"This may sound like the dumbest thing on the planet but bear with me.

I believe a lot of my PPD comes from going from being competitively athletic to completely back to square one fitness and endurance wise. I think the lack of exercise and PPD antagonize each other greatly in my case.

Walking doesn’t make me feel better because some days even a few miles with the stroller can level me, dependent on my mood/hydration/if I was able to est that day, and it often makes me cry that I’m not running. 

I can’t currently afford a membership to the gyms in my town.

However.

Someone put a few Richard Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies tapes on YouTube.

I wish I wasn’t genuinely saying this, but I think they saved my life a little bit? 
I am a big fan for YouTube workout videos, but when my PPD is bad, doing even “light no impact HIIT for beginner” workouts breaks my heart and makes me cry about how little I can do at the moment.

But sweating to the oldies is SO SILLY and they’re an hour long and it’s all these cute fluffy hair older ladies just dancing with you and it just lets your brain take a vacation. My infant literally laughs at me from the swing while I do it too, so ... added bonus.

get_release,"So a few days ago I told my husband about how breastfeeding really fucked up my already not-great boobs and how one basically folds in on itself any time I try to put on a normal (not sports) bra, let alone get any cleavage going on. Even though it definitely bothers me a little deep down, we laughed about it light-heartedly. Well tonight I initiated sex, finally feeling myself for once so we started up when all of a sudden he burst out laughing hysterically because he remembered what I said. I got upset, pushed him away while he apologized, and hid under the covers.. everything I've been holding in for months just came pouring out in heavy sobs.

I'm not a crier but it just really fucking hurt. I know it wasn't malicious intent but I've been trying so goddamned hard here not to sink. I'm stuck home with the baby all day, every day, groundhog day. Feel fat, unfulfilled, unproductive, inadequate. My hair, skin and nails look like shit. We really can't afford any extras right now like an unnecessary haircut or little luxuries like manicures as we just moved- getting the house together for function is the biggest priority.. also diapers and especially baby's specialty formula are just plain ridiculous.. (every time I buy formula, I feel a distant, tiny stab in the heart, a reminder that my shitty body failed me and I couldn't feed my own baby. Mostly over that but still stings) 

I wander around in a daze from task to task, wearing spit-up stained raggedy pajamas, reheating the same cup of coffee 15x yet somehow only end up sipping from it when it reaches to that gross, stomach-turning level of lukewarm. I cook (something I used to really enjoy), clean, do laundry, pay bills, make phone calls, pack lunches, help with homework, do dishes, make endless lists.. feed, change, and entertain the baby.. try to get motivated to organize something to eventually finish getting moved and settled.. realize it's 3pm and I haven't eaten yet (btw I barely eat anything, why am I still a fucking whale?!), try to get some kind of protein and slam a V8 and put on an unconvincing happy face for when my daughter gets off the bus. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

I do find joy in little things but it takes a lot of effort most days. I have almost no self confidence or feeling of self worth anymore. I'm disgusted with my post pregnancy body. I can't seem to muster up the discipline or motivation to change it. I feel detached, try to engage with and pay attention to my older daughter however she, like any other meaningful connection feels so far away. I feel stupid for feeling sorry for myself. And this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Now I'm laying here thinking I shouldn't have ever said anything to him because that's all he's ever going to think of when he looks at me and I can't deal with that because I'm inches away from hating myself.

I'm barely running on autopilot anymore. My PPA PPOCD and PPD are tipping the scales. I thought I had it under control though it's obvious I don't. I'm somehow simultaneously a robot and an emotional wreck. My kids deserve better. I'm really ashamed that I can't pull it together in any sense of the phrase.

gentletemple,"Hi, long story ahead. If nobody reads or replies, I'm okay with that. I don't blame you because I hate reading this much text too. I'm just doing this for catharthis and maybe there's somebody out there who has walked in my shoes. So far in my life I haven't met anybody that's gone through this, and most of the support is for the person suffering from OCD and not specifically for the partner.

We had amazing sex that day she found out she was pregnant and I thought the worst was behind us. I was so wrong. That was over 10 months ago and things have rapidly declined since then. I was naïve to think a pregnancy was the answer to our relationship problems.

My wife, who is an experienced psychotherapist, has severe mental health issues (GAD, OCD and now postpartum OCD) that have reached a point where I'm ready to leave the marriage, but we now have a  son and I want to save our family. I'm no saint, I have all my own flaws too but this is insanity and I'm at my wits end with how to fix this. We have been together since high school and I truly love her, but these issues have severely damaged our relationship in the last few years.

Chapter 1: Infertility, GAD and OCD

This all started 5 years ago when we began trying to have our first baby. After years of unexplained infertility, my wife's generalized anxiety disorder and OCD tendencies became exacerbated to the point that it was impacting me and making it really hard to be a compassionate supporting husband. It began to smother me as she began to resent life and she directed all that anger at me. I really hated being around her and I didn't feel safe at home, so I stopped coming home. I went out with friends after work just to have some fun. After a while of this, she fell into a deep depression and she told me she felt abandoned in the hardest time of her life, and wanted to commit suicide. The only thing that kept her going was her obsession with having a baby.

I realized what a selfish asshole I was being and I re-committed myself to her. I started leaving work earlier, getting us into social circles, going to church to encourage her spirit and give her hope, going on fun dates together and traveling around the world, researching all the possible ways to have a family so she felt like we had a plan together. I wanted to start my own business but I had to put that dream aside for hers. My investments and savings for business got used now for an adoption and IVF treatment fund.

There were 2 more years of this infertility (total over 4 years before it ended) In the meanwhile, our relationship continued to go south because of her contamination OCD behaviors, but I kept putting myself aside for her dream to have a baby. She took on 3 jobs just to distract herself with busyness so she wouldn't spiral into depression thinking about infertility. Our sex life no longer became fun, and intimacy pretty much died. I would be her emotional punching bag one minute and then switch to her sperm donor ATM on command. If I ever refused sex because I didn't feel loved, it became a huge fight and I quickly learned that my feelings on the situation didn't matter. I felt like I was being a good husband with my time and resources and not getting anything back in return. I pretty much felt invisible as her husband, and we basically became roommates in pursuit of her goal to have baby.

At this point in the relationship I started to realize how much her OCD and anxiety was affecting my behaviors and my happiness. My behaviors were adapting to hers. I started seeking out attention and validation from outside the marriage. I also began abusing substances like alcohol and weed to mask my feelings, so I sought out therapy for myself and I convinced her to go to an OCD treatment center. She went for a bit then dropped the treatments when they became too scary for her. I stayed in therapy for myself because I needed someone to talk to. My therapist expressed much concern over trying to bring a child into the world in our state of things, but all I could control is myself.

I convinced my wife to see her own talk therapist to cope with the generalized anxiety disorder, and join a couples therapist with me to strengthen our relationship. I had to practically drag her into this one because she was oblivious to our relationship problems due to her fixation on getting pregnant. So that's 3 therapists we were seeing every week now. Things began to look up, at least we were communicating better, and I felt more supportive of her because I had support for myself.

There were glimpses where she remembered who I was to her and I had my old wife back. I remember one specific occasion where I was scheduled to undergo surgery for the infertility, and she got extremely scared I was going to die so she had me cancel the surgery. She confessed her love and care for me and I felt like I had my old wife back. That was short lived, as soon as the fear of me dying was gone, she went back to thinking about infertility and I didn't matter once again.

In our therapy sessions, every single therapist said we had reached a crossroads where the therapeutic goals for our relationship could not be reached until she got serious treatment for OCD. She used the excuse that treatments would stress her out and be too triggering to conceive a baby and so she refused to do it.

Chapter 2: Pregnancy and Postpartum OCD

&amp;#x200B;

It was at this point that my wife became pregnant. She was ecstatic and I was relieved. She dropped out of her own therapy for the reason above, and she didn't see the point of couples therapy now so she stopped going. Looking back on it, I think she only went because she was afraid of me leaving her and she really didn't want any hiatus on the pregnancy attempts.

We had amazing sex that day she found out she was pregnant and I thought the worst was behind us. I was so wrong. That was over 10 months ago and things have rapidly declined since then. I was naive to think a pregnancy was the answer to our relationship problems.

Pregnancy just made her worry worse than before. She quit all her jobs and spent all day worrying. She was calling the triage hotline multiple times a day for the entire term. It's understandable right, after 4 years of infertility, she wanted everything to go right. I get it. But she absolutely cast me aside and didn't seem to care at all because she deemed the baby's health more important than my feelings. She practically hasn't laid a finger on me since that day she got pregnant. No kissing, no touching, hugging, nothing because she is afraid of contamination. What's worse, she expected me to still be a loving and supportive man and can't seem to understand why I didn't feel motivated to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the baby is born, should be a relief right? Nope. During the hospital stay and at the pediatrician's after, the staff expressed much concern for her. They pulled me aside and said they've never seen anyone this bad and I should get her help immediately.

This freaked me out so I brought up the issue again several times after the baby is born. She is just not willing to face it and she gets very upset with me for talking about it. In her defense, I get frustrated and angry that this situation keeps getting worse and she isn't willing to do her part to fix it.

Within the first week of my son's birth we were talking about separating just to have peace in the home for our son. I thought this was insane how we got here so I suggested counseling again.

I was able to get her to come to couples counseling with me again, but only one session. The therapist once again said she needed to work on OCD, and this made her drop out. I dropped too because fuck it I can't make her and I don't have the energy anymore.

At home I am not allowed to touch my son and I'm missing out on bonding with him. My wife is hibernating and won't let anyone come over. Grandparents haven't met their grandson. She says this is because of flu season and that's all it is, but she will not give me a concrete time of when it will be safe and life can go back to normal. I expressed my concern that maybe she is too isolated and she violently resists this and says I need to trust her more.

The house is a complete mess, but she won't let me do laundry or dishes, and I'm confined to a few spaces where its safe for me to hang out. I can't go near the baby's bassinet or in his nursery or his bathroom. She will not let me hire a cleaner or invite her mother over to clean. I am however expected to clean up trash and she generates A LOT of waste. She leaves the faucets and showers running unattended for up to 30 minutes. I get dozens of boxes shipped to me from Amazon every week. We fill up maybe 6-7 full bags of garbage per week and I'm running to the dumpster 2 times a week in addition to trash day. Why all this trash? She buys things off Amazon and then throws them away when they get contaminated. She's buying expensive devices and things to ease her mind about the baby. A lot of times they are never even used, she just gets an anxious feeling and doesn't want it anymore. I think I make good money but I'm killing myself working and I have nothing to show for it now because my savings account keeps draining every paycheck. I feel so disrespected by that and I've tried to communicate it to her but she doesn't change anything.

Her OCD has infiltrated almost every area of the home and marriage to the point where I feel supervised constantly and don't feel safe in my own home. But I can't leave because I am expected to be home supporting her and the baby. She wants me around to pay the bills and be her emotional support system and be present for the baby. Keep in mind I want to help! I want to be involved!

Chapter 3: Where do we go from here?

I fell into a depression in the last few months. The thoughts of sacrificing my dream of owning a business for her dream of having a baby hurts so much because she knew about this dream of mine since we were teenagers. The thought of having to leave a wife I love and a son I love just to feel better. I felt alone and rejected and hopeless. Once again burying myself with drugs, alcohol and porn in attempts to feel better, but it didn't help. One day I was driving to work and I thought about crashing my car just to make the pain stop. I realized how selfish that was and I didn't want my son to lose his dad, so I started seeking help again. I began working out at the gym a lot and I cut out all substances. I signed up with a male therapist who specializes in exactly the kinds of issues I'm dealing with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling a lot better these weeks so I felt ready to have tough conversations again. Things came to a head tonight when she got jealous of me going to the gym for my mental health. I said I was so unhappy that I can't stay in this marriage. I told her I felt like I gained a son and lost a wife. I told her I felt like she was cold, calloused and hates my guts. She said she loves me 99% of the time and would be devastated if I left. It's not her intention to hurt she says. She cares about me still.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that I was emotionally manipulating her and backing her into a corner. She asked me to stop bringing up anything related to finances, her OCD, or my desire to interact with my son. She said every time I bring it up it makes her feel worse and triggers her anxiety and removes her sense of security in the relationship. I get that. But I'm a human with feelings and I deserve to be seen.

&amp;#x200B;

I need her help to break a dysfunctional pattern we have built up over the years. The one where I become frustrated, put up emotional walls and become distant from her. I lose all motivation to want to be a supportive partner in the ways she needs. Then we talk it through and I feel closer to her, and safer expressing myself, so I let her back into my inner world. In my eyes I'm giving her an opportunity to connect with me and help me, and it gets payed back with more feelings of rejection.

Whether it's malicious or not, conscious or not, it doesn't really matter the intention or the intellectual reasons behind it, it still hurts emotionally and damages my attempts to rebuild intimacy. She gives me a sense of connection and belonging with her words, then takes it away with her actions. She says it's the anxiety and she's not choosing it, it's not personal. That doesn't mean much to me because it still hurts. I don't get why it has to be me or the baby, why can't it be me AND the baby?

I lose trust in her and I put the walls back up. And the cycle continues, except the next time it takes extra courage to ask for help and it hurts extra worse when I'm let down again. I don't know how to break this pattern and I really need help. I feel like I've tried to show her the damage its doing to me, but it's not sinking in, and I'm seriously running out of ideas.

She said she will try medication and get therapy when the baby is older. There's no concrete plan there. She asked me to tough it out a few months longer. I'm guessing she means in the summer after flu season is passed, but judging by how history went, this is just another way of me enabling her mental illness and putting my own needs aside. It's clear to me that I'm not a top priority in her life anymore because the anxiety is all consuming, and I just can't see when it will ever end.

The only hope I have left is that everybody says anxiety and OCD are treatable. The question is when will she realize how necessary it is? And will I still be around to see that happen?",Postpartum_Depression,[long venting] the damaging impacts of OCD/PPOCD on a spouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/exmady/long_venting_the_damaging_impacts_of_ocdppocd_on/,1580662488.0,2020-02-02 09:54:48,

I remember one specific occasion where I was scheduled to undergo surgery for the infertility, and she got extremely scared I was going to die so she had me cancel the surgery. She confessed her love and care for me and I felt like I had my old wife back. That was short lived, as soon as the fear of me dying was gone, she went back to thinking about infertility and I didn't matter once again.

In our therapy sessions, every single therapist said we had reached a crossroads where the therapeutic goals for our relationship could not be reached until she got serious treatment for OCD. She used the excuse that treatments would stress her out and be too triggering to conceive a baby and so she refused to do it.   


Chapter 2: Pregnancy and Postpartum OCD

&amp;#x200B;

It was at this point that my wife became pregnant. She was ecstatic and I was relieved. She dropped out of her own therapy for the reason above, and she didn't see the point of couples therapy now so she stopped going. Looking back on it, I think she only went because she was afraid of me leaving her and she really didn't want any hiatus on the pregnancy attempts.

We had amazing sex that day she found out she was pregnant and I thought the worst was behind us. I was so wrong. That was over 10 months ago and things have rapidly declined since then. I was naive to think a pregnancy was the answer to our relationship problems.

Pregnancy just made her worry worse than before. She quit all her jobs and spent all day worrying. She was calling the triage hotline multiple times a day for the entire term. It's understandable right, after 4 years of infertility, she wanted everything to go right. I get it. But she absolutely cast me aside and didn't seem to care at all because she deemed the baby's health more important than my feelings. She practically hasn't laid a finger on me since that day she got pregnant. No kissing, no touching, hugging, nothing because she is afraid of contamination. What's worse, she expected me to still be a loving and supportive man and can't seem to understand why I didn't feel motivated to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the baby is born, should be a relief right? Nope. During the hospital stay and at the pediatrician's after, the staff expressed much concern for her. They pulled me aside and said they've never seen anyone this bad and I should get her help immediately.

This freaked me out so I brought up the issue again several times after the baby is born. She is just not willing to face it and she gets very upset with me for talking about it. In her defense, I get frustrated and angry that this situation keeps getting worse and she isn't willing to do her part to fix it.  


Within the first week of my son's birth we were talking about separating just to have peace in the home for our son. I thought this was insane how we got here so I suggested counseling again.

I was able to get her to come to couples counseling with me again, but only one session. The therapist once again said she needed to work on OCD, and this made her drop out. I dropped too because fuck it I can't make her and I don't have the energy anymore.

At home I am not allowed to touch my son and I'm missing out on bonding with him. My wife is hibernating and won't let anyone come over. Grandparents haven't met their grandson. She says this is because of flu season and that's all it is, but she will not give me a concrete time of when it will be safe and life can go back to normal. I expressed my concern that maybe she is too isolated and she violently resists this and says I need to trust her more.  


The house is a complete mess, but she won't let me do laundry or dishes, and I'm confined to a few spaces where its safe for me to hang out. I can't go near the baby's bassinet or in his nursery or his bathroom. She will not let me hire a cleaner or invite her mother over to clean. I am however expected to clean up trash and she generates A LOT of waste. She leaves the faucets and showers running unattended for up to 30 minutes. I get dozens of boxes shipped to me from Amazon every week. We fill up maybe 6-7 full bags of garbage per week and I'm running to the dumpster 2 times a week in addition to trash day. Why all this trash? She buys things off Amazon and then throws them away when they get contaminated. She's buying expensive devices and things to ease her mind about the baby. A lot of times they are never even used, she just gets an anxious feeling and doesn't want it anymore. I make $2,500 a week and we are still bleeding out $2k a month on these expenses. I think I make good money but I'm killing myself working and I have nothing to show for it now. I feel so disrespected by that and I've tried to communicate it to her but she doesn't change anything.  


Her OCD has infiltrated almost every area of the home and marriage to the point where I feel supervised constantly and don't feel safe in my own home. But I can't leave because I am expected to be home supporting her and the baby. She wants me around to pay the bills and be her emotional support system and be present for the baby. Keep in mind I want to help! I want to be involved!  


Chapter 3: Where do we go from here?

I fell into a depression in the last few months. The thoughts of sacrificing my dream of owning a business for her dream of having a baby hurts so much because she knew about this dream of mine since we were teenagers. The thought of having to leave a wife I love and a son I love just to feel better. I felt alone and rejected and hopeless. Once again burying myself with drugs and alcohol and other distractions, but it didn't help. One day I was driving to work and I thought about crashing my car just to make the pain stop. I realized how selfish that was and I didn't want my son to lose his dad, so I started seeking help again. I began working out at the gym a lot and I cut out all substances. I signed up with a male therapist who specializes in exactly the kinds of issues I'm dealing with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling a lot better these weeks so I felt ready to have tough conversations again. Things came to a head tonight when she got jealous of me going to the gym for my mental health. I said I was so unhappy that I can't stay in this marriage. I told her I felt like I gained a son and lost a wife. I told her I felt like she was cold, calloused and hates my guts. She said she loves me 99% of the time and would be devastated if I left. It's not her intention to hurt she says. She cares about me still.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that I was emotionally manipulating her and backing her into a corner. She asked me to stop bringing up anything related to finances, her OCD, or my desire to interact with my son. She said every time I bring it up it makes her feel worse and triggers her anxiety and removes her sense of security in the relationship. I get that. But I'm a human with feelings and I deserve to be seen.

&amp;#x200B;

 I need her help to break a dysfunctional pattern we have built up over the years. The one where I become frustrated, put up emotional walls and become distant from her. I lose all motivation to want to be a supportive partner in the ways she needs. Then we talk it through and I feel closer to her, and safer expressing myself, so I let her back into my inner world. In my eyes I'm giving her an opportunity to connect with me and help me, and it gets payed back with more feelings of rejection. 

Whether it's malicious or not, conscious or not, it doesn't really matter the intention or the intellectual reasons behind it, it still hurts emotionally and damages my attempts to rebuild intimacy. She gives me a sense of connection and belonging with her words, then takes it away with her actions. She says it's the anxiety and she's not choosing it, it's not personal. That doesn't mean much to me because it still hurts. I don't get why it has to be me or the baby, why can't it be me AND the baby?

 I lose trust in her and I put the walls back up. And the cycle continues, except the next time it takes extra courage to ask for help and it hurts extra worse when I'm let down again. I don't know how to break this pattern and I really need help. I feel like I've tried to show her the damage its doing to me, but it's not sinking in, and I'm seriously running out of ideas.

She said she will try medication and get therapy when the baby is older. There's no concrete plan there. She asked me to tough it out a few months longer. I'm guessing she means in the summer after flu season is passed, but judging by how history went, this is just another way of me enabling her mental illness and putting my own needs aside. It's clear to me that I'm not a top priority in her life anymore because the anxiety is all consuming, and I just can't see when it will ever end.  


The only hope I have left is that everybody says anxiety and OCD are treatable. The question is when will she realize how necessary it is. And will I still be around to see that happen.",Postpartum_Depression,[long post] the impact of OCD on a spouse and how I lost my wife to anxiety and OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/exm4xn/long_post_the_impact_of_ocd_on_a_spouse_and_how_i/,1580661510.0,2020-02-02 09:38:30,
leeharrison1984,"Back story:  
At birth, our son received a diagnosis of Down Syndrome. This was a huge shock to us, and was completely unexpected. Our son is now 8 months old, and the following has been happening since we brought him home.

Current Situation:  
My wife is completely beside herself with guilt about his Down Syndrome. She found out that the mother is typically the cause of the genetic defect, and cannot overcome it. She is boxing me out, and making a martyr of herself in almost any situation. We had a disagreement this evening when he wouldn't fall asleep in her arms due to her anxiety, but she couldn't give him to me to put down because then she felt like a failure as a mother. We had a mostly civil conversation about what had happened, but this is daily for me. My reserves of energy and empathy are drained, and I feel like my wife is taking energies we should sooner spend on our child and his development. Every day feels like a minefield, and the smallest inconvenience can send her nuclear. She is in outpatient for the last few weeks, but I don't know if she is properly utilizing the counseling or is just phoning it in. Both her mother and father are concerned, as well as myself. It is nearly impossible to make it through a single day without her having a full-blown breakdown, even though nothing particularly tragic occurred. I just don't know what to do anymore, and feel like I am at my breaking point. If I take her out of the equation, I can enjoy our son despite his impending surgery, and give him the best life I know how. She is spends most days on the couch watching TV while scrolling Facebook. Procrastination has become a way of life for her, and she lets everything pile up until it is a catastrophe. I don't mind picking up the slack because I understand how she feels, but the daily explosions of anger and frustration and the smallest of issues makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home. Her unhappiness is seeping into me, and I worry how it will affect our son as he gets older if it isn't taken care of by then.

bcaterra,"So I’ve been feeling like absolute crap. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. I’m about to break. I’m a junior in college and don’t feel like I have the energy to get up and go to class anymore and it’s only the third week of school. I don’t feel like doing anything. 

I went to my doctor a few weeks ago and he upped my Zoloft, yet again. My boyfriend was out last night drinking and I was here by myself with the baby. My mom had just left to go back home and everything was fine. She’s been helping us a lot around the house and with the baby because I’ve had a sinus/ear infection. Well last night I finally started to feel a bit better physically, but my mental health rapidly declined. I called my boyfriend crying my eyes out and terrified. I was terrified that I was getting her sick by holding her and that someone would break in on us. I spent an over an hour crying hysterically. 

I’ve been having terrible nightmares and they have caused me to be really paranoid around the house. Nightmares of my baby being taken away and kidnapped. I don’t know why these dreams keep reoccurring... maybe some PTSD of abuse I experienced earlier in my life. Anyway, I have a hard time leaving her in her bassinet by herself, or going to sleep not knowing if she’s going to be there in the morning whenever I wake up. 

I’ve posted on this sub before, but I feel like every time I go back to the doctor, things just gradually keep declining. I thought I was finally starting to feel better, but now it’s turned into major anxiety. I’ve thought about admitting myself to the hospital multiple times because I’m not okay. I have to be honest with myself and everyone else that I’m not okay. It would tear up my family if I was admitted. I don’t want to do that to them, but I feel like I need to look out for my mental health and it is not okay. My boyfriend came home last night and comforted me. We watched a show on tv and he told me that we would talk about things later. Before going to bed, he asked how I would feel about getting admitted. I didn’t know what to think. He’s never been the one to suggest it, I have. He told me that he thought it would be the best thing for myself, him, and our daughter for me to seek more help. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to miss that much class. It sucks to not be able to take care of my own freaking mental health because I’m scared of missing school and not being able to attend lecture, or failing due to absences. I already have 3 absences in one of my classes. I nervous about leaving my baby behind. I’m nervous that if I do admit myself voluntarily then I will be shipped off to an inpatient treatment facility for a while because my mental health is that bad. I don’t want to leave my baby, but I’m shaking right now and I don’t know if it’s  because of a medication side effect, paranoia, or due to my infection. I just needed to get this out there.

NekoKitty919119,"Idk why I can't get adjusted to my baby screaming or crying. She is 16 months old and I feel nothing but resentment towards her. I hate how clingy she is and how she cries for everything. She recently got into pinching, fighting, screaming, biting, hair pulling and it upsets me because I don't hit her. When I feel low i hand her to her dad and take a breather but lately that hasn't been enough anymore. I'm tired of the same routine every day. I'm tired of sleepless nights and not being able to function except out of fear, anger, resentment. It's gotten to the point where I want her and her father to get their things and leave. I'm so angry with him because he is lazy. Everyone in the hospital told him to not let her get used to the bed, and to jot carry her unless she was crying. Due to me having a c section, didn't care that I was in grad school finishing my masters and I needed her to be as independent as possible. Nooope. He sabotaged that, I get it we are in love with her but he did spoil her and get her used to the bed and to being held all the time to the point I have to go to the bathroom sitting with her on my lap. I can't even wash dishes without her having a melt down. I can't stand her temperament either. She has melt downs everyday over things that had she not been spoiled wouldn't occur. She has a meltdown over me not looking at her all the time. I turn away to wash a dish or put away laundry, and she cries as if someone is beating her. I worry that I'll get the cops called on me when I'm trying to take a shit alone. It doesn't help that my parents think my PPD is fake and only occurs when she acts horrendous.

Opalrose25,"
Tldr: My symptoms escalated and I ended up being admitted to a psychiatric hospital. It saved my life.


I was hit with antepartum depression halfway through my second trimester. Antidepressants helped once I found the right dosage. Counseling saved me when I became suicidal in my third trimester. I thought everything would level out once I had her. I. Was. Wrong.


My symptoms gradually worsened as I tried to wean off my antidepressants. I ended up having a major crash from sleep deprivation and my dosage change. I don't remember much from that night other than being crouched down in the hallway crying outside my baby's nursery. My husband tells me I also tried to leave the house in the middle of the night.


My meds were adjusted again and I was feeling better until I got back to work. I quickly started deteriorating and going downhill faster than I could fathom. You name the symptom, I had it. Self hate, agression towards my husband,  feeling distant from my baby, weight gain, anxiety and panic attacks, OCD, PTSD from my c section (I felt WAY MORE than I should have) suicidal ideations, memory loss, my jaw permanently clenched... I could go on and on.

Everything came to a headway on Sunday. I left the baby with my husband and essentially ran away from home. I found myself at a park down the road from my house and I wailed. I had never wanted to die more in that moment than any time before. I couldn't take the emotional and physical pain anymore. I was done.

My husband in a panic called my therapist who called me and advised I go to the ER. I was adamant that I didn't need hospitalization, but she knew better. After much deliberation, I finally caved. Hospitalization was my last stitch effort to survive this terrible disease. With one foot in front of the other, I walked into an ER and uttered the words ""postpartum depression with suicidal ideations.""

I am so amazed and thankful for the hospital staff. They attended me with compassion and understanding. I was tranferred to a psychiatric hospital where I spent four days in an ""intensive care"" unit. Four long days of intensive therapy, a slight medication change, classes on coping, and community building with others like me. By day three, I truly felt whole again. I remembered who I was before all this mess. I was discharged yesterday and was able to return home to my wonderful husband and beautiful baby. 

I'm not going to lie, it was a hard journey. Im still on it, but I want  you to  know there is light at the end of this dark shitty tunnel. I want to let you know it's okay to admit you need more help. I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are loved. You are worthy of all good things and deserve peace.

I hope you find your peace. Know that although hospitalization is scary, it's worth fidning yourself and coming out a better partner and mommy. 

One of the most important things I learned during my stay is that we don't have to be perfect, just good enough. Perfection ends up making our little gremilns neurotic and at higher chance of developing their own mental illnesses. My doctor says that a C+ parent is ideal. 

Please don't wait until you are too far gone to seek help. Please know that hospitalization is an option and know that it's better for you to go in voluntarily than involuntarily. It's definitely better than being dead.

Thisuckz,"I'm feeling so unattractive, ugly, fat, gross..... I tried buying new underwear... too find out I'm too fat to wear a large anymore. Lady at Walmart tried to make me feel better by saying ""they run small"". Let's face it. I'm a cow anymore. I just want to feel pretty and sexy again. 
I made this stupid account thinking it'll help me. But I feel stupid for ranting, but in all honestly I'm too poor for a psychiatrist, and I feel bad for burdening my family and husband with my feelings. So here I am telling the whole stupid world how I feel.
My husband says I'm just as beautiful and sexy as our wedding day. But let's face it, I was ""chubby"" back then. Now I'm a fat cow with gross stretch marks all over my belly. 
Some have mentioned I should have a day at the spa, spoil myself with new ""sexy clothes"" as they put it, get my nails done, a new hair style ect. But I'm too poor for all of that, and what's the use of something new to wear when we haven't gone on an actual date since the day we got engaged in 2018.
We use to cuddle all the time, but my husband doesn't like too anymore, he says he's just too tired once we get the baby asleep, but I can't help feeling its because he doesn't want to cuddle a cow. Who could blame him. He use to put his hands in my back pockets while I did dishes or cooked, and pull my shirt up just enough to put his hands on my bare belly and hold me like that for what seemed like forever. But not anymore. 
I eat when I'm extremely depressed like now, but then I see all these skinny beautiful girls at work, some with babies the same age as my little one, and then I get so depressed I stop eating thinking I'd get skinny that way. But then this fat cow see's chocolate, cookies, salsa, anything yummy, and I indulge. My poor husband probably thinks I'm a pig too since I'm always eating.

She is very emotional and angry. Always on the edge and defensive, insecure. Always heading for the conflict (with me and other people). 

Recently I have opened myself with a lot of tenderness and care. We had sex for the first time in a very long time. For a few days there was a lot of magic between us. Then suddenly everything crashed over a very trivial matter. She told me I was passive aggressive while I was trying to resolve this problem. She tried to hurt me emotionally as much as possible. She even told me that I tricked her to have sex. 

We hardly speak now. I think we both feel more distance than ever before. 
I want to leave her. I can’t stand the way how she is affecting me.

I stopped them in May because I was felling great (big mistake ) and they were giving me a lot of side effects and I wanted to be pregnant again . So here I am 31 weeks pregnant and I suddenly feel deeply depressed . Like deeply . I Was put on bed rest early in pregnancy so my career is standing by and other people without kids got promoted instead of me . My sweet 2 years old irritates the hell out of me , I am angry towards him as I was when he was born even if I do love him and feel guilty . I am exhausted all the time and I cannot bring myself to do anything all day long . Hubby doesn’t find pregnant women attractive so no intimacy, which makes me feel like every aspect of my life has been sacrificed for children . I am fat, or at least I feel like I am (was skinny before ) I am now hitting the gym since I am not on bed rest anymore and it improves my mood slightly but then I think what’s the point ? In2 months I’ll have a newborn and no help and I’ll never ever get to do some sports again . I didn’t reach out for help because counseling did nothing for me the first time and meds made me fat and sleepless and tired as hell and I already am all of this . I am thinking about giving up the baby for adoption and ask my parents if they can also adopt my 2 years old but I know it’s the depression talking for me, maybe?. But I fear that I’ll commit suicide with a newborn in 2 months. I was fine until a week ago now I feel like the worse mum and human being ever . 

Anybody else went through this ? I’ve never been depressed before being a mother but maybe I just suffer from mayor depression and this is how my life is gonna be from now on.

harvestmoonwitch,"I have OCD. I’ve been on Prozac since I was 19. They raised my dose from 40mg to 60mg while pregnant because of the extra fluids and blood flow, but I haven’t really noticed a change. I was anxious my whole pregnancy that something would go wrong and would literally daydream about being postpartum and having the baby here so I could see him and know he was okay. 

Obviously I was naive, because he’s here now and all I do all day is worry about if he’s okay. He’ll cuddle up with me or his dad and then feel warm afterward, and I’ll obsessively check his temperature. I google everything. Every grunt, sneeze, cry, or odd facial twitch terrifies me and sets off a 911 alarm in my brain. He literally just had his first pediatrician appointment and they said he’s strong and good. He eats a ton, which worries me, but the pediatrician said some babies just have bigger appetites than others and he was already back at birth weight and makes plenty of wet and messy diapers, so he’s doing fine. But for some reason I still panic about everything and worry constantly about him getting sick. 

My parents were in town, but just left this morning and my husband goes back to work first thing tomorrow. My sister lives with us, so I have someone here, but she’s younger than me and having my parents here made me feel safe because they feel more “adult” than I do and know what to worry about and what not to. My husband is also incredibly level headed and can keep me feeling calm and safe. His mom is coming over to help while he’s at work, but I’m not super comfortable with my in-laws and their parenting skills and almost feel more stress at the idea of her helping me. 

Also, my labor was long and I narrowly avoided an emergency c-section due to high heart rate and fevers from a Chorio infection, so the birth didn’t go as I’d imagined or hoped and was quite stressful for me, resulting in a 2nd degree tear. So I’ve also been obsessive over my health as well and have been crying a lot and panicking, which makes me feel dizzy or nauseated or hot and that only makes me obsess more and worry that I could drop dead at any moment. I worry they overlooked something and my infection isn’t cured or whatever and they released me too soon, etc. Just not rational, but these thoughts still rush through my head and make me start sobbing, especially without my parents here to reassure me and knowing my husband has to be gone for a big chunk of every day. 

I have a therapy appointment on Thursday and am hoping that helps. I’m also hoping that now that I am PP that my meds start working more effectively. But I’m not sure if that’s how it works? I am taking steps to make sure I get treatment for this, but it feels difficult in the meantime. All this worry and panic feels heavy. 

I’ve been trying to meditate, which has helped slightly. And I know there are a lot of hormones running through my body. But I feel exhausted no matter how much sleep I get (which, I’ll admit, is minimal even when I have someone watch the baby for me) because I have so many thoughts rushing through my head all day. 

So my OCD has gotten worse for sure. It feels like where it was when I was a teenager. I don’t know exactly why I’m posting this. Maybe to feel less alone?

Sometimes even his little shrieks that would normally be cute in another mom's eyes make me feel irritated. My breaking point came when I snapped at him in the car when he was inconsolable. I KNOW it's wrong and I feel bad about how I feel. But it's so strange. I can't control it. I love him so much. We're nursing and that's going great. I think he's the most adorable baby in the world.

siirius03,"Hi y’all. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been battling PPD/PPR(rage) for many months now after a year from hell. 

In a nutshell, hubby left 3 days PP (second baby was born a year ago) because he had to go on a military tasking in our home province, about 2 hours away from our hometown and where both of our parents live. I flew to our hometown 3 weeks later with both kids, and stayed with my dad and his gf. His gf made my life a living hell there, I tried to be out of the house as much as possible and spent days/nights visiting other family and my hubby. After about 3 months I couldn’t take it anymore and moved in with my in-laws who I don’t exactly get along with. That only lasted 3 days before my MIL flipped out and I left, then I moved in with my sister into a tiny little room on an air mattress with my 2 kids. Where we stayed for the remaining 2 months. 

After being there for 5 months total, hubby and I  drove back home. Get home to discover we lost our entire friend group, I lost my job due to budget cuts, just so many things continued to go wrong. He’s now overseas and is wanting a separation. 

I am no longer the mother that I once was. I was a wonderful mother to my first born. Calm, patient, loving. Now I’m miserable, quick to snap, most days I don’t even want my kids around me. The baby is needy, whiny, my eldest is being a typical 3 yo. I have no friends and no family to help. I have no alone time which I so desperately need. Hiring a sitter isn’t even an option due to finances. I’m being touched and needed all day everyday and it’s becoming way too much for me. I’m not on medication because the previous times I’ve tried them, I hated them, they didn’t make me feel good at all. I’ve been taking vitamins and I’ve started iron transfusions as per doctor’s recommendation but I don’t think it’s working.

While most parents feel that their lives are completed or their child is the best thing to happen to them, I always feel the opposite.

The ties that she creates with everyone would no longer exist and the burdens will have left with her as well. She looks at me, she coos and smiles, I’m all that she knows. Every beautiful baby sound is a reminder of a mistake I can’t reverse. She sits and plays, so unaware that the only one she loves and knows is staring back at her with regrets. I sometimes feel like one us just needs to go.

C section left me so miserable i couldn’t give birth so I stated smoking weed again (stopped during pregnancy) I wanted to wait until I was breast feeding for a year but I couldn’t take it, and the weed did something to the milk my son didn’t like, it didn’t harm him at all but he got more fussy after eating so I switched to formula but I felt even worse that I couldn’t breast feed either now. I developed BV while pregnant and it hasn’t gone away and it makes me smell so bad, and I gained so much weight I know it all made him less attracted to me, and now my ppd has only gotten worse. I’ve attempted suicide twice in my life and failed. First time I kinda(?) od’d and was unconscious for a few days. Second time I was crying so hysterically that I threw up the pills a few I’m tired after taking them. Had an awful stomach ache for a week after that. And in all those moments where I felt lowest, I’ve never felt as bad as I do right now typing this. I guess this is my call for help or whatever idk. I don’t feel like a real mom or a real woman.

HereComesMama,"My 2nd baby girl was born via c section September 17 2019. I had a c section because I was too afraid to attempt VBAC (I know it was ultimately my decision but when you're hearing from almost everyone around you that I should just do a repeat c-section, it was kind of tough). My first was an emergent c-section. I had a miscarriage between my two daughters. My first daughter was difficult to breast feed because she was very small and ate almost every hour. But, I was able to just lay in bed with her constantly and establish my supply, luckily. Then she had HORRIBLE reflux and was actually pooping blood. Needless to say, I stopped breast feeding at about 3 or 4 months because it wasn't an amazing experience. Ok, back to baby number 2. The second c-section wasn't easier, it was worse in fact. Lots of students in the room including the one cutting me (and the anesthesiologist, YIKES! I didn't know until she poked my back more than once and later was talking with a peer about ""being new""). I was vomiting in the OR and for about 1 day after...horrible dizziness and nausea. My milk came in hard once we got home (as did with my first) and I started over producing which was ok BUT my daughter wasn't latching right. I kept pumping and saw lactation consultants over the next week or two. She was diagnosed with a mild tongue tie which I opted to have treated because maybe that was affecting her latch. Nipple shields weren't helping either. The tie treatment didn't help her latch. Then I developed thrush. I then developed an infection in my c section sight which popped open the incision about 3 cm. I had to pack the wound myself over the next 2 weeks, and it's STILL not healed after almost 3 months post partum. My baby figured out her latch but couldn't drain my breast effectively so always came off screaming for food (even after an hour between both breasts). I tried to keep pumping but my supply started dropping and I couldn't pump as frequently as needed because I have a mobile (and mischievous) 2 year old. I decided a couple days ago to put away my pump and nursing clothes. Formula it is. Everyone is supportive but I can't help but have these intrusive thoughts that they're secretly judging me for not trying harder. I feel guilty. I feel like a quitter. I feel like a wimp. I know, logically, none of these things are true but... I can't help but feel this way. I'm exhausted (duh, waking up every 2 hours will do that to you, even with my husband's help I'm exhausted). I see women who are thin\\fit with a 6 week old. I see them smiling, looking put together and breast feeding with ease. They had an easy vaginal delivery, quick recovery time, baby latched with no problem and EBF because ""breast is best"" (I know it is, and I know fed is best, but I hate that line... it seems like a consolation prize). A friend says ""there's no trophies in motherhood"" and I know it. I know I'll rock the toddler stage because I'm doing it now with my 1st daughter. But damn... I'm just bummed in general.

smilesavorsail,"\*\*Venting\*\*\*

\*\*\*If anyone has any advice when you finally begin to feel normal...or if anything I mention sounds like what you have gone through please share\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like no one talks about postpartum. You see all these individuals who bounce back, they have the beautiful bodies, sweet babies, and look like a million bucks. Honestly I thought contractions would cause me to scream my lungs out like they do in the movies and so I didn't pay any mind to my labor pains. They didn't feel like what I saw or how some people described it, so I figured nothing to really pay any mind. Ended up going to the hospital to get checked out, instead got rolled in for an emergency cesarian section. I was looking really forward to a natural delivery. What can I do right? Was grateful for a healthy child, and was checking things off my to do list. Need to start walking 24 hours after cesarian, I need to have a bowel movement, need to make sure I am walking, staying hydrated, talk to lactation consultant to ensure child is latching properly. Then the bloody women from birth certificate department comes in and asks me to fill out the bloody paperwork for DD birth certificate. Hubby is away traveling, and I am just staring at this women. I started to almost have a hysterical breakdown because I couldn't even remember how to spell my own name or even my husbands and I forgot how to spell DD name. Like what the actual FUCK is wrong with me. I couldn't even recall how to spell any name, and filling out that paper was like asking me to argue my dissertation that instance. Thank god for my lovely nurse who saw the look on my face and said I'll tell her to take an L and ask you tomorrow. Bless that nurses dearest heart. But honestly those fucking birth certificate lady needs to fucking as anyone but the mother to fill that fucking form out. Like I am still high on drugs. I am not about to make a mistake on those forms. The chick gave me a panic attack. By the time it was my DD feeding time, I forgot that I forgot how to spell any of our names. 

So I finally get rolled out of the hospital and come home. Feel great the first two weeks. Hitting all the expected milestones that the doctor wanted me to do. Then all of a sudden Week 4 pp I am in such severe pain I dropped DD twice. Took my azz to the hospital and was admitted for a week. So depressed to be away from DD, and more so than anything. Bless the GOOD LORD that I didn't curse up a storm when this fucking dickwad comes in on day two to tell me we found nothing on the CT scans, or blood work and I don't think you have any actual pain and it is all in your head or the medical term for that is Somatophorm Disorder. That means I have depression causing fucking pain which is causing me to fucking drop my DD and fall in my fucking ass so hard that I hurt myself. Mind you I wouldn't have been so pissed if he told me this after doing all the necessary tests that were deemed by all my various specialists. Thank GOD that he still had to follow hospital protocol and did my complete MRI where they found the ISSUE. The look on his face was equivalent to me smashing my DD poopy diaper on his face. He comes in post MRI and just makes it seem like nothing. I swear if I could smash my foot up his ass I would have felt so much better. Like I swear the moment I found out what was wrong from the neurologist I was so grateful. I was pissed that dumbass couldn't be clear when he told me my MRI results. Like NO MY PAIN IS NOT IMAGINARY. 

So finally after week in the hospital FINALLY I had an answer as to what is wrong with me and I am being discharged with instructions to follow up care and on treatment schedule. So finally was home getting some rest, now this is where things start going downwards for me. These past three weeks has been pure test of mental and emotional stamina. I have had to use herculan strength not to snap, yell, constantly irritated and angry. Small noises irritate me, people talking to me makes me angry. Conversations feel like I have to do organic chemistry labs. Talking to people feels like so much work, this past week I've just been so tired me and DD have literally slept for 20 out of the 24 hours. And FINALLY today I just snapped.

I have done such a wonderful job of keeping up a wonderful front. Cooked a huge meal for my family, we had dinner and while I was making dinner I pulled on a stitch that was throbbing. My head was dizzy and feel like I have a head cold, so foggy. I have been working all day to keep my temper in check. I have NO HONEST TO GOD REASON to be irritated or anger. I'm getting angry with my own behavior because it makes no dang sense. I was slowly walking down the stairs when I saw the basement door left open and I snapped. I fucking just snapped, and walked to my room and just cried non stop. I was in so much pain, I was in so much fog in my head. I just felt like there is no way I am going to be able to get better. Like the saying fake it til you make it. I couldn't fake it anymore. My sister, brother, mother come in and calm me down. But I seriously can't take it anymore. I understand intelliectually that I had a serious surgery. I understand that I do, but my head is not accepting the fact that I am at least not normal. Meaning why can't I walk faster than fucking toddler. Why am I moving slower than my newborn. If someone asks me a question I have to ask them to repeat themselves so much that I've seen them get irritated because it feels to them that I am not listening. Its like the expressway from my ear to my brain is as jam as LA traffic during rush hour. My head is soo fucking dizzy for no reason. I've checked my blood pressure and sugar and they can not explain my dizziness. My sister tells me my PT is going to make me feel worse before I get better. Why the fuck does no one tell you about the hell that is postpartum. 

I do not recognize myself in the mirror. My husband tells me I look amazing and I only took a fucking shower. Am I this horrendous on a day to day that a shower makes me look so different. I have ZERO appetite. Like I never eat I would be fine. I sleep so much it is not funny. I have not gotten a damn thing done. I need to go to Secretary of State to renew my license, I forgot so much to the point that it is expired. I have to go and get my diploma and I can't get the strength to even do that. I literally forget! The only think I am able to do competently is dress my DD, feed her, burb her, bathe her, play with her, sleep with her...and repeat. Showering myself is a challenge, putting on socks is a challenge, bending feels like applying to PhD schools. Like I thought I was pretty fit, my abdomen feels like the barren dessert, there is NOTHING. I swear I look like a log, The only curves I have are that dip from my chin to my neck. I have no waist, my muscle feels like a water bed, my hair is shedding, my skin can't even give me a break. Clothes feel like sandpaper on my skin. I am comfortable in tanks, light cotton. Like how the fuck am I suppose to dress like a mature adult and go to work while not trying to cry in the bathroom every other minute.

What the fuck is wrong with me. I just feel so much like a mess today. How does one get over this, where is the light at the end of this fucking black hole. I am sooooo fucking tired of my doctor repeatedly telling me I had major surgery and to give time. I have been an energizer bunny all my life this feels like punishment. I want to be able to be there for my DD, I want to be able to function as an adult. Like what is wrong with me?

Maltese_the_Cat,"I had a difficult pregnancy followed by an even more difficult time after the birth of my son. I struggle with miscarriages and my husband and I were extremely excited when I made it out of the first trimester. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes fairly early and was put on bed rest after a car accident. I had weekly ultrasounds to track my son's progress and was told that he was perfectly healthy.

He was not immediately given to me when he was born. When he was five minutes old I was told he was missing both thumbs. When he was a day old, he was transfered to the NICU because he was asperating. At four days old, he was transfered to a much larger children's hospital an hour away.  Then at eight days he had surgery to fix an esophageal fistula.

While my son was on a ventilator, I was hospitalized with mastitis and what they believed was an abscess. They did not drain it and after three days I was released. It was the longest three days of my life. I just wanted to be with my son. Less than a week later the fever came back and this time my hospital visit was much longer. It also turns out that my abscess is not an abscess but a tumor that was infected by the mastitis.

I was released from the hospital the day before my son came home. We've been home for a week and a half and I'm struggling. 

My son still can't eat properly, he's had a feeding tube and is connected to a pulse oximeter.  Between doctors visits and his feeding schedule, I haven't healed from the mastitis. I'm waiting for my milk to dry up so that I can have surgery to remove the mass in my breast and I haven't even began to process that I might have breast cancer.

I'm depressed. I'm sick of people asking how I'm doing and saying that I'm strong for what I am going through. The truth is that I'm crying when ever I'm alone and I don't know how to ask for help. My husband is busy working but helps where he can. He actually makes sure I get a solid six hours of sleep in the evenings and makes me breakfast. Honestly, he's been amazing. But I'm still struggling to sleep and finding time to eat. I love my son more than anything but there are times when I just feel numb to the situation, to my husband, and to him.

I don't know what to do. I had a plan on how to handle postpartum depression but I don't have the time to go to a support group or therapist because of my son's feeding schedule or both of our doctor appointments.

skinnyfat3000,"Hi there, I've been diagnosed with ppd yesterday by my gp and I'm currently looking for a therapist. Today is the first day I'm all alone with my 4.5 week old and I'm wondering if you have some tips on how often to socially interact with the baby and how long. I know I'm supposed to talk to and play with the baby.

How often and how long a day is enough so baby will develop normally? If my SO interacts with the baby in the evenings, is that enough? If I talk 5 minutes during ach diaper change and touch all of baby's limbs each time, would that be enough? Is it necessary to talk in baby speech and smile or is a normal face sufficient?

I know these are weird questions but one of my symptoms is that I don't have a natural desire to interact socially with my baby (of course I feed, diaper, burp and carry baby around until baby stops crying) and I don't want baby to be developmentaly delayed because I don't do it often enough.

Are there any cues that I can watch out for that baby wants to interact socially? So far I have now and then tried to show some toys or make weird faces (suggestion by a development app), but each time baby started crying. Baby is currently lying in the crib, flailing arms and making ""eh"" sounds, sometimes looking in my direction. Would this be a good time to interact, and what type of interaction should I do?

My daughter is a rainbow after a miscarriage i never felt anything but joy and gratitude with her, she was such a good baby, she's my sunshine.

I go back to work in 2 weeks. He doesn't take a bottle well, you have to fight with him for him to take it. (He has 5 brands we have tried found his preferred but he still cries). I feel like breastfeeding him makes me stuck to him. I feel guilty that i don't want him to be stuck to me. I feel like hes taking time away from my daughter. 

He drains me so much. He wakes up so much and since he only breastfeeds my husband cant even help. I'm scared to go back to work. I work in a goddam children's hospital. It made me sad even before i was pregnant so I'm scared on wtf I'm going to do with all this crying. 

3 weeks ago i went to a very dark place. I felt like i was in a dark hole, couldn't see the light at the top anymore but i was just sitting in the whole not trying to get out. I didn't want to move or be alive. Unfortunately i couldnt stop my tears. My 4 year old said 
""Whats wrong mom why are you crying"" 
I told her"" im sad baby "" as im holding the baby feeding him

I begged them to look again and after some minutes of nothing, my daughter appeared along with her heartbeat. I was put on bed rest indefinitely. I then started suffering from depression as could hardly work, couldn't go out and was terrified to even cough or sit up, thinking i could lose her at any moment. I suffered panic attacks and became suicidal but docs refused to give me antidepressants. At 6.5 months i collapsed with arrhythmia and high blood pressure and they couldnt stabilize me, they wanted to do a csection and were moments away from taking me to theater when i stabilized. I was put on bed rest again and became even more depressed and anxious, developed insomnia, and was in great pain. Meanwhile we passed through a tough time due to my work as an investigative journalist- lets just say i was attacked by the gov and hounded publicly. I became more anxious and stressed. I went to the doctor begging for help and she and the midwife laughed in my face repeatedly and told me to ""calm down and think of the baby"". I ended up having an emergency csection at 37 weeks, i was so anxious they told me i would have general anaesthetic but when i got to the operating theatre on the table, they changed their mind and said i would be awake throughout. I was terrified and hysterical. Hours after birth my MIL physically assaulted me and tried to take my daughter out of my arms. She sneaked into the ward twice on the days i was there recovering and proceeded to criticize, harass me and cause me huge anxiety. At home, her harassment continued until i got so stressed from her and the trauma of my ordeal that my milk dried up. I had to return to work (from home) 4 days post partum, with the help of a nanny at home. My SO has stood up for me agains MIL but i dont think he understands what I'm going through and how the last year has scarred me. I work 60 hours 7 days a week, take care of baby, and 5 year old step son, and the house and i feel he doesnt appreciate me. He's changed our daughters diaper maybe 5 times, fed her less than 10 times and never got up in the night. He complains i don't want sex or fall asleep at 8pm after being up since 4.30am.

Im dealing with overcoming my prenantal depression and trauma i suffered, working 60 hour weeks self employed, am now no contact with MIL but im still so angry, managing my work and philanthropy, running the house, taking care of children, trying to maintain friendships, financially helping my elderly parents in another country, trying to make time for me, and trying to make our relationship work.

DernhelmOfGryffindor,"
I’m 11 weeks post partum and I have been feeling depressed for the past 6 weeks. My doctor was concerned because of my post partum questionnaire and offered medicine but I’m not convinced that medicine will help. I had a very difficult labor and recovery, and my body still doesn’t have the stamina it did before childbirth. I had to go back to work at 7 weeks post partum to a very active job, which has been really hard. It was a stressful unpaid leave that I had to fight for to even get that much time off. I was still asked to do some work from home during that time and had lots of emails with HR about various logistics that I had to suddenly take care of. Honestly it was a bit of a nightmare.

My job is very stressful and I feel like I’m not doing the best that I could be. It feels that I’m constantly behind and bringing stuff home, even when I spend 9-10 hours a day there. I hate being away from my baby. I just want to be with her. My husband is awesome and keeps asking what else he can do to take the stress off me, but it doesn’t feel like there is anything he can do. We also are raising three older kids as our own and they have transitioned beautifully to having a baby in the house. I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better transition. 

I realize that I have a great life and that I have so much to be thankful for, but I’m miserable and crying all the time. I feel like I hate my life and just want to run away, but then feel so guilty for feeling that way. I’ve always been pretty driven and motivated, so I never thought I’d want to stay home, but I guess I do now and it’s hard to accept that it’s not financially an option. With the older children, I was grateful to work because it was a distraction from all the court dates and uncertainty of whether they could stay with us. But now that everything is settled, I feel like I’m failing as a mom by working full time. I get insanely jealous when I see others working from home or even staying home with their kids. I hate leaving my baby, but I want to be able to provide a good life to all my kids. I feel so much pressure that I want to scream. I go back and forth between sobbing and feeling numb. It all feels like too much and that I can’t do it. Even my go-to things that help me when I’m going through an emotionally hard time or grieving have lost their appeal. My husband wants me to talk with my doctor more about medicine, but I don’t see how it can help anything as all the pressure I’m feeling will still be there.

throwwwwmeawayynow,"Crossposted from r/beyondthebump

I feel like this is going to make some people mad (and rightfully so) but I just need other moms to talk to. Just somebody.

I’m in my (very) early twenties, in my second long-term relationship. I got pregnant a few months after meeting the father. Due to him being very religious, and myself being bipolar and impulsive, we kept the pregnancy. Towards the end, I began looking into adoption (on my own) because I wanted my child to have the best life possible and I didn’t think I could give that to them. 

My baby was born with special needs. I don’t really want to go into exactly what for personal reasons, but they will more than likely never be independent and in his first month of life I already have to follow up with 5+ specialists. 

I can’t go back to work due to the care my child needs. His father makes around 25k a year, so we’re living off of every government benefit we can and my son’s disability check. He’s now 1 month old.

We’re looking at the reality of losing our apartment when our savings run out in a few months and will have to move across the country to live with his parents, where there is a significant language and cultural barrier. I will be completely alone.

I brought up adoption with my partner after the birth of our son. He has been supportive, and then changed his mind, which I completely understand. We got as far as selecting an amazing family who was willing (and happy) to take on our son. 

I cry every night, although I don’t feel depressed. I just truly feel like my life is over. I do not want to be a mother, which feels disgusting to say. My son needs someone who is 1000% in this, not an unstable disaster. It’s not even his disabilities. I think I would feel this way with a “typical” child. I did feel this way before I knew about his diagnoses. My partner has told me that I can leave, but I want my child to be in a BETTER situation, not worse. My parents asked me if I would have aborted had I known his condition and I told them no, and I stand by that. 

I’ve read articles, books, forums - talked to other moms with kids like my son, and I just feel more and more sick to my stomach about the future.

I don’t know if there is anyone out there who has been in a situation like this. I know it’s stupid to ask for no judgement, but please understand that I love my son and I’m worried about being a negative in his life rather than a positive.

I feel like it’s not entirely PPD, due to the responsibilities of being a parent to a child with special needs, along with being emotionally and financially unable to care for them without help.",Postpartum_Depression,I need help,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/d6qd56/i_need_help/,1568982884.0,2019-09-20 05:34:44,
Kalldaro,"I feel like I will never not feel guilty about having PPD with my second. He was wanted and I was excited about giving my older son a brother. But about a month before his due date there was a traumatic incident in the family, I went into labor three weeks early and suffered severe PPD in the coming months. He had developmental delays, which are common in my family, there have been many late bloomers. But I still feel responsible for them. We've also been dealing with hearing issues. He had to get tubez in his ears and they may have to be redone. But as a result he's speech delayed although can communicate well non verbally.

I had trouble bonding with him the first year and I know how important that is.

He's very sweet, loves to cuddle and was quick to learn his numbers, colors, shapes and alphabet. But I still feel like I failed him.

ppdmb,"\*\* This was only supposed to be a couple of paragraphs but I went overboard. Sorry.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before I begin, some background. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety about 5 years ago, and OCPD a year and a half ago. I was on Zoloft and Xanax for a year but I had to stop cold turkey when I got pregnant because it compounded the morning sickness and I couldn't even drink water without throwing up - I lost 30 lbs in a month from the constant vomiting. 

My pregnancy started out really rough. I had just started a really intense architecture program in school and I had no time for anything. I would literally stay in school for days at a time working on project after project, barely sleeping and only consuming caffeine and whatever snacks the vending machine had to offer. There were a few times that I would go home after 30 hour stretches at my desk, take a nap for an hour, shower, and go right back to school. I was running on fumes. I don't blame my SO for feeling abandoned by me during this time, but the strain was too much and we began fighting constantly. He resented me for spending so much time at school that the few times I did have to rest, he would make plans with his friends and refuse to see me. The sleep deprivation, the lack of proper food, the stress, and now his rejection was too much for me to handle. We began a group project and I got close to one of my team mates. Because we spent every waking hour for 4 weeks together, it felt good to have some sort of attention. We never did anything physical at all, it was all sort of emotional. My SO found out, and sparked another string of fights. In the middle of all this and between major projects, we booked a trip to another city to see a show. That's the weekend I got pregnant. 

I found out I was pregnant about a month after our trip. It was bittersweet. It felt as though everything that had been piling up had cleared and he and I loved each other again. We were definitely not expecting to get pregnant at all, but we're old enough that it's not the worse thing in the world that could've happened. When the morning sickness started and I couldn't get out of bed, I decided to drop out of school. It was a really hard first trimester. I was barely going to work, I was always getting sick, my bills were stacking up. I couldn't afford my insurance anymore, so I got on Medicaid, but my therapist doesn't accept it, so I had to pay for therapy out of pocket, which meant my weekly visits dropped to once a month. I didn't feel comfortable telling anyone just yet, so I dealt with all this in silence. SO was very supportive during this time and always there to comfort me when I could barely move from nausea. 

When the second semester began and I started feeling better, I finally had more energy to pull myself out of debt. I started applying to a bunch of new jobs and at my 5th month of pregnancy got a job as a contractor for the government with great benefits. My SO and I decided that we were stable enough to be able to afford moving in together, so we rented an apartment. When spring came, it brought along insane water retention and swelling. i started gaining a ton of weight and my feet swelled up so much that none of my shoes fit. I felt like a fucking parade float. My SO didn't want to tell anyone until we reached 20 weeks, so I didn't. 20 weeks came and went and he still didn't want to, so I was patient. Finally at 24 weeks he told all our friends. Everyone was shocked but happy, we were the first in our group of friends to have a baby. Even though everyone knew, I still felt really alone. I could talk about what it was like, but none of my friends really understood. Whatever. 

Third trimester hit, and I was growing more and more worried about maternity leave. The policy at my new job was that in order to get paid maternity leave, you had to work there for at least a year. I was freaking the fuck out about bills and stuff. My amazing supervisor kicked it into high gear and started the paperwork to convert me to a full government employee so I could get the benefits before I gave birth. I'd come home crying with anxiety one day and the next day be ecstatic with the latest update regarding my conversion. My emotions were all over the place. I was officially converted at 37 weeks pregnant, and gave birth at 38 weeks. It was like my baby knew that if she waited a little bit, we'd be fine. 

The birth was surprisingly easy. I had a feeling she would come 2 weeks early. My SO begged her to wait until after the baby shower and she did just that. I had been feeling Braxton-Hicks every 3-4 hours, so I knew it would happen any day but I wasn't worried. We got home from the baby shower, brought the presents up, I took a shower, and as I was getting ready for bed my water broke. All of a sudden I was having contractions every 2-3 minutes. I was freaking the fuck out. I had 38 weeks to wrap my head around the idea of having a baby, and it was suddenly time and I wasn't ready. I sat on the toilet with amniotic fluid pouring out of me while I had a full on panic attack. I was shaking and I couldn't breath, I felt like I was going to vomit and I had insane diarrhea. When my SO got on the phone with my OB, she told him to bring me to the hospital because I was in labor. He was calm and ready. I was losing my mind. I didn't want to leave the toilet because the fluid kept coming, but I didn't have a single pad on hand since I hadn't had my period in almost a year. I was sane enough to think of grabbing a diaper and we made our way to the hospital. We got there around 1:30 am, the checked my cervix and I was only 1 cm dilated. They told us to get comfortable because we would be there for hours. I lasted until about 10 am when I finally asked for the epidural. Once it kicked in, I was great. My OB happened to be the doctor on call, so we felt at ease. When it was time to push, she told us to get ready for a few hours of labor, but to everyone's surprise, it only lasted 30 minutes. My sweet baby girl was born. I was so dehydrated that I couldn't even cry but we were all emotional. I held my tiny and she looked at me with the widest and most curious eyes and I was instantly in love.

Then they moved us to the maternity ward and we were left to fend for ourselves. After checking the baby, they wrapped her up and brought her to the room. The next 48 hours were awful. Whenever I tried to feed her, it was the most painful thing I had ever felt in my life. Like her tiny mouth was full of battery acid. The nurses kept shoving her onto my breast and ignoring my pain. A lactation consultant came and told me that she wasn't latching right because breastfeeding shouldn't be painful (lie). We spent hours working at it. I eventually stopped complaining because none of the nurses cared that I was in pain. They never offered to give her formula, just left us to struggle through feedings. She only ever fell asleep out of exhaustion, and she woke up constantly due to hunger. I asked the lactation consultant about possibly pumping and she told me that I have to call my insurance because the hospital doesn't deal with renting pumps directly then left. Apparently, they have pumps in every room but that was never an option presented to us. After two days, we were cleared to go home. I was so ready to get out of that hospital room. 

The first week was brutal. We didn't sleep at all. She was barely eating and I was in excruciating pain. The effect of the pain medication had worn off and my vagina was in ruins. My nipples were sore and cracked, one started bleeding. But from being constantly dismissed at the hospital, I didn't call anyone or ask for help. She was constantly crying for food and I was in constant pain trying and failing to feed her. I broke down crying every time she had to eat. When she was able to get some sleep, my anxiety kicked into overdrive and I couldn't sleep. I began thinking about all the SIDS warnings and had it in my mind that she was going to choke and die. Any little coo she made I would jump out of bed and grab her. When her first pediatrician appointment came,  her doctor discovered she was pretty severely jaundiced due to malnutrition. She was born 5 lbs 15 oz and she had dropped down to 5 lbs. We had to take her to the emergency room for light therapy. Into the NICU she went. I felt like a complete failure. I only had my baby for 5 days and already I was killing her. 

When she was in the NICU, the nurses that were in charge of her care were like angels sent from heaven. They sat with me and watched me feed her, coached me through getting her to latch correctly, comforted me when the pain came, and introduced me to my first breast pump. My breasts were so full that when I pumped for the first time, I cried from the relief I felt. They were the first ones to give us a damn break and let us give the baby formula. My baby was so hungry she finished her first 2 oz bottle in less than 5 minutes. We couldn't stay with her overnight, so we went home without our baby. For 2 nights, the anxiety of her dying made me jolt awake every 20 minutes to check on her, only to cry myself to sleep when I realized she wasn't there. 

When she was finally released, I felt such relief. I thought all the bad experiences were over. My SO had managed to get 3 weeks of paternity leave, so we were great, until he had to go back to work. Luckily, my mom was on vacation for 2 weeks and she was over every single day to help me with the baby. She's let me sleep a bit and clean or cook something so I could eat. But those 2 weeks came and went in a blink of an eye and I had one last week to face by myself. I had huge anxiety about being left alone with her. I kept thinking I was going to drop her, or I'd fall sleep while feeding her, roll over, and crush her. Or go to the bathroom to pee and she'd choke to death while I was gone. I refused to sleep or eat or pee. I'd hold it until my SO came home from work then run to the bathroom. At this point, I was in so much pain from feeding her that I stopped breastfeeding altogether and only gave her formula or whatever I pumped. Mind you, the depression hit real fucking hard and I was really only pumping once or twice a day so my milk production plummeted. She would wake up and cry for food, and I'd freak out. What made it worse is that whenever I gave her formula, she would spit up these huge clumps of phlegm. when she napped, it sounded like she was choking. I went to her doctor with my concern and he told me it was normal, she'd get better with time. But as the days went by, she only got worse. She reached a point where she developed really severe eczema all over her face, it looked like someone had burned her. I took her back to the doctor and that's when we discovered she had cow's milk protein allergy. Once again, the feeling that I was killing my baby returned. We had to get rid of her regular formula and get her hypoallergenic formula. The doctor told me to stop giving her my milk altogether, but I had read online that if I stopped consuming dairy, it was ok, so I disregarded that instruction. I was determined to get her better, and what better remedy than breast milk. Unfortunately by this point, my milk was so depleted that I could only make 2 oz per day. Yet again, I felt like a complete failure. 

I started trying to breastfeed her again, only to find that it was 10x more painful than ever. Like her gums were made of a million cattle prods that attacked my nerve endings. It took everything in me to not scream from the pain whenever I fed her. This wasn't normal. I started getting random fevers and body chills, but I ignored them. My baby eating was more important than my comfort. 

While all this was happening, the problems with my SO picked up again. It started when he went back to work. I resented him for having time to escape our apartment, time away from the baby with other adults. I was stuck at home watching the baby and listening to her cry all day. When she'd sleep, I was too anxious to sleep with her, so I'd clean constantly to stay awake. Now, he's always been kind of messy, leaving dishes in the sink, paper towels around, nothing too crazy. But when I was left alone, the little things he did that never bothered me became the focus of my anger and frustration. I started resenting him for leaving a dirty dish in the sink, for leaving his socks on the couch, for not making the bed. The more I lashed out at him, the more he pulled away. Then the day came when he had a dinner with his coworkers. It took every fiber of my being to not rip him a new asshole. How the fuck could he think it's ok to leave me alone with OUR baby when I've spent every second of the last 5 weeks with her and he's free to go to work. This was an optional outing, and he chose to leave us and go have fun. Fun that I wasn't allowed to have. 

I kept telling myself that he deserved a night off, he had been amazing and super patient with me and my overwhelming emotions and anxiety. He constantly offered to watch the baby and give me a few hours to myself, to go out or sleep in. But all I felt when I considered taking him up on his offers were how bad of a mother I would be if I left my baby. So I never left my baby, and I blamed him when he wasn't to blame. He started to sense my resentment, and reached a point where he wasn't going to take my shit anymore. Instead of being understanding, he started to shut me out. 

After I reached 6 weeks pp, I was finally cleared to go back to work and resume normal activities. It was like he was given the green light to be a complete creep. He started constantly groping me and being super aggressive with his advances - but luckily he was still respectful enough to stop when I said no. When I did say no, he would get really irritated and ignore me for the rest of the day. He couldn't understand that just because the doctor said I was cleared, it didn't mean that I was ready to have sex again. I had gained 50 lbs during my pregnancy and was having a really hard time losing the weight. I felt like a disgusting blob of fat. None of my clothes fit me. I was covered in dark red stretch marks. Whenever I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I'd have to hold back the vomit from pure disgust. How could I have sex? Not to mention that when we did try just so I could get him to back off me for a while, we couldn't do it because it was too painful. So since he couldn't get more than a hand job here and there, he started being a complete asshole. I couldn't ask him to do anything without him getting an attitude. I complained to him about the paper towels he'd leave scattered around and he hit me back with ""well, the trash can is right there"" and walk away. 

That was last week. This week, I finally decided to go to the doctor for the pain in my breasts. Turns out I have a combination of mastitis and thrush - it wasn't just in my head. That's when everything started to bubble up to the surface. All the emotions I've suppressed for the last year came at me in full force. So Tuesday night I sat in bed and cried in the dark. My SO asked me what was wrong and I didn't want to tell him, but he insisted to I did. I spent an hour writing out everything, being very careful with my word choice so as to not sound like I was attacking him, he's very sensitive and takes everything personally. I thought I did an ok job, but he hit me back with an equally long text complaining about me and my attitude and how I never want to fuck him and he's neglected. I read the messages out to my therapist last night and even she almost started crying from his response. 

So now I'm sitting here at work (been back for 3 weeks now) on a new account I made so he wouldn't find it and letting it all out to you guys because I can't turn to him and I can't turn to my friends and I feel lost and alone and every couple of weeks I find another reason to think I'm killing my baby and I've reached a point where I feel like a literal cow. My SO comes home and he gets to sit with her and read and play and bond while I do the dishes and the laundry and the only time I have with my baby is when I try to feed her, which is not the perfect bonding experience because I'm in excruciating pain and when I can't take the pain anymore and I take away the boob, she starts screaming. I can't tell him because he'll just hit me back with more shit.",Postpartum_Depression,"10 weeks postpartum, losing my shit (super long, sorry)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/d3vbel/10_weeks_postpartum_losing_my_shit_super_long/,1568432626.0,2019-09-13 20:43:46,

MumsGotNoMilk,"I got pregnant on accident. I was on birth control, but I’m in a loving and supportive relationship, and in a good place for a kid, I just wasn’t ready yet. I saved up money for a vacation, had dreams to buy a house and a new car... but now I’m using my money to cover the cost of not working for maternity leave. I had a life planned that didn’t involve having a kid for at least a couple years.

But when I got pregnant, I cried. I mourned the loss of that life I thought I’d have, and got myself ready for this new life ahead of me. It wasn’t entirely out of the picture, just out of sequence, and I kept telling myself that it was okay this way.

Pregnancy sucked. Morning sickness, swelling, gestational hypertension, constantly urinating, a three day hospital stay for complications during 2nd trimester, being treated differently just because you’re pregnant... I wasn’t a fan of this process, but it could really have been worse. I was also under a lot of stress because I started work in a new specialty just before I found out, and I go to school full time.

I was so excited when my contractions finally hit 4min apart. But then they stayed at 4min apart for three. Effing. Days. I couldn’t sleep, one time they gave me morphine to help me sleep and sent me home, so I got about 4-6hrs of sleep then but after over 24hrs of not sleeping and no progress (was not dilating this entire time), I came back in to get another dose to get some rest. My blood pressure was too high and they ended up inducing me. Exciting, right? I was finally going to get this thing that had been causing me pain and keeping me from sleep to stop. 

Well, we induce, got to 4cm and then I was asked if I wanted an epidural. Since I hadn’t any sleep going on 36 hours, I accepted. I thought a good nap in, I would have more energy for this labor thing.

Unfortunately I got a very rare complicated of the epidural that put me in immense pain, and then when they replaced that epidural, the same thing happened and I was in immense pain for 20+ hrs. I really should have opted for no meds for my birth at that point and had them take everything out, but I was already paralyzed, tired, and I couldn’t make decisions anymore at that point, I was in far too much pain. I barely progressed at all in those 22hrs. My water broke at some point during that time, I think they said 14 hrs from birth. When they finally removed the second failed epidural, they told me our best option at that point was an assisted delivery.

So I got a spinal block instead, since they couldn’t even examine me without pain. The pain of pushing was nothing compared to the pain everywhere else I felt. The spinal (which was very painful and took 30minutes to be placed) took that pain away for once, but it dropped my blood pressure and they had to administer emergent meds, my baby, nearly at the same time, was in distress, his heart rate was in the 200s and climbing. I had a stage 3 episiotomy. 

They pulled him out with forceps quickly and the room was silent, he was not crying and he was pale, dusky grey, even. I held him for a minute after they got him breathing again, but after all that, I didn’t know what to do. I imagined us being skin to skin, immediately trying to breast feed, but none of that was possible and they had to take him away to the NICU shortly after. We already agreed that if anything happened, my husband would be in the NICU with our baby, so that’s what he did. 

It was so strange to have a room full of people, and then have no one in seconds. It was just my nurse and I, and she got me all set up, I had to be straight cathed because I wasn’t peeing, and there was blood everywhere. She got me cleaned up as best she could and stayed with me. I had no baby. I had no husband. Not even a doctor stayed after.

I wish I could say that’s where it all ended, but I feel like I made some poor decisions even from here out. The neonatal specialist updated me and asked my opinion on breastfeeding vs formula feeding since his sugars were dropping, and we were separated. I told her if it was impossible for us to be together for breast feeding, as we were both in poor shape, then anything to have my baby fed was fine. My poor baby was in terrible pain for days after birth, but luckily not a bone was broken. We had a good latch together, but after a couple feeds, my nipples were raw, he was basically drinking my blood at that point. We found out he had a significant tongue tie, that inhibited his intake, which wouldn’t be able to get fixed for him to feed for 3 days, so we did our best with feeding and supplemented with formula as was suggested to us. His weight was just dropping too much.

Once we got his tongue fixed, and I had been pumping and trying to get keep my supply up, he was eating better. At our two week check, he gained enough weight that I was cleared to be able to try and breastfeed alone, however my production tanked never increased, despite constantly pumping and trying to breast feed. 

I don’t know if I want to continue breast feeding or not. I hate watching him struggle and be hungry while we tried to figure out how to feed him. I hated watching him be in pain day after day. But if I don’t breast feed, what was the point in putting him through the tongue clipping? How selfish do I have to be to have someone slice my child’s face, just to help with breast feeding, only to quit and give up on that plan anyway?

I felt defeated, because this whole journey has been nothing but one thing after another, nothing going as I envisioned it, even in the slightest. I feel robbed of the life I could have had to some degree, I feel robbed of my body, I look in the mirror and I don’t recognize myself anymore, and I feel robbed of these wonderful experiences everyone talks about as a new mom. I feel a bit rejected now too, because he used to latch so easily but now he only wants the bottle, and when he does nurse from me, I know he doesn’t get much... I feel like a human pacifier, I don’t even fulfill my duty as food producer.

None of this is my son’s fault, and I feel so incredibly guilty. And I feel worse because I’ve had no appetite since giving birth, I have been forcing myself to eat and drink just a bit each day, and I’m tired of crying every day. I don’t want any more problems, I just want to bond with my son and focus on my little family with my husband, and move forward smoothly. But nothing about this is smooth.

Since my OB caught on about the not eating, she has referred me to the social worker, after diagnosing me with PPD, and will be attending my first group meeting on Tuesday.

unsoundguy,"I will not be able to check very often but anything could help. 

Thank you. 

I am having a nervous breakdown while at work as I don’t know what is going on and how bad it is. 

She is barely sleeping.  The less she sleeps the worse it gets. 

I know that this is not PPD alone as this has happened before we had kids. 

She starts by saying she needs to pee then I find her in the basement on the computer.   Or disassembling the house( making it messy). 

Then I ask her to try to stay in bed and I’m told that I’m a piece of shit, to fuck off and that I want her dead.  

I will take as much as I can.  Yes I blow up sometimes but I can only get yelled at so long before I snap.  And when she tells our 2 year old the fuck if and shut up.  That’s the line. We do not talk like that in our house. 

Im about to quit my job to take care of them if things don’t start to get better.  

I have not slept in weeks because I am scared what she may do. 

If there is anything anyone can say I’ll listen. 

Oh. We have gone and got sleeping meds. She is only taking half the dose that she was told to do.

Partner gets up maybe once a night with him, on a good night. Many nights he doesn’t get up at all. Most often he will wake me if I don’t respond fast enough.

Last night he walked in when I had put him down for five minutes while screaming. By that stage it was 2am. I had been cluster feeding and holding him since 6pm. I needed a goddamn minute. Well. Partner comes in, sees baby crying and flips it saying I must have PPD because who would leave their kid screaming and not wrapped. Baby was literally in the cot for three minutes.

megmeg29,"Throughout my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression; I used to self medicate (with marijuana) as I will not go on any actual medications - and eventually was able to manage and cope effectively by changing my lifestyle and mindset. I quit smoking weed and felt like I was in a good place.

Then when I got pregnant the anxiety started. I prepared myself for the postpartum period as much as I could , but could never be truly prepared. I worked with a postpartum nutritionist and coach, went to therapy and practiced a lot of self care from the very beginning. Just recently my benefits expired and I no longer have access to these support resources and I feel myself getting very low.

I don’t have a support system at all. My relationship with my mother is not existent, and the relationship with my mother in law is more stressful the helpful. I’m the first of my friends to have babies. 

I am so disinterested in anything that made me happy before. I feel like I wake up every day with a dark storm cloud over my head. I fight with my husband constantly and feel unfulfilled at home all day living the same day on repeat. Then I feel guilty because my daughter is the cutest fricken thing and all I’ve wanted my entire life was to be a mother.

My husband tries to be encouraging telling me to set small goals , start a bit of a routine... that’s the only way things are gonna change if I start doing things for myself. I used to work out 4 days a week, eat healthy, appreciate my body. Now I feel like I just hate myself, and soothe myself through eating junk food and watching tv. I don’t feel motivated to do absolutely anything good for myself. I understand that these things will help shift things but right now ... I just feel like I don’t have it in me.

I am just feeling so alone, and wishing I could run away from my life. I would never ever kill myself because I could never do that to my daughter or husband, but I am having such a hard time in this challenging season of life. I want so badly to just feel good. Stop wishing things would change and just accept each day as it is. 

I should be grateful, I get to spend every day with my daughter- I’m on maternity leave; I can’t even imagine how the mothers in the states are coping back at work so soon; then I feel even guiltier - like it could always be worse.

The only “positive self care” I do is take a bath, like three times a day... I would just live in the bath if I could. I’m constantly checking my phone, like I feel seriously addicted, just trying to escape. I know I’m going to look back and miss these days so why can’t I just live in the moment and appreciate it.

I wish I could just cure this depression; but I feel like I don’t have the energy to. I don’t want to go on medications, I want to find a way to heal this naturally and permanently.

The thing I’m most worried about is how my mental health will be. I don’t want to seem like I’m jumping the gun by *assuming* I’ll have PPD, but my mental health has always been a struggle my whole life.

I struggle with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, generalized anxiety, and I’m in recovery for an eating disorder.

She’s just told me I should maybe set up an appointment with a psych doc for some time after the birth and hasn’t talked to me about it after that.

I’m not here to complain about this or seek help fr him, I’m just saying my mental health will be my issue to deal with.

happymama23,"If you know me in real life please don’t bring this up to my family. 

I’m in need of a vent. 

I haven’t been happy since birth. I’ve known I’ve needed to get help but I have a hard time talking face to face with my emotional issues. I post on here, feel validated and supported, then move on until the next night. I used to express my depression through anger but now I’m just quiet. I feel like just giving up and running away. I’m very self aware I eat mood enhancing foods and listen to upbeat music. Today was just a out of the ordinary tough day. And it’s a long story....

A few events have happened to lead up to me texting my ex boyfriend / friend of over 5 years. I saw a license plate that said CRLSBD on it which is where I met S. My dog is dying which I got when I was with S. I’m moving and I’ve found several items given to me by S. So I texted him and he talked for almost 6 hours with back to back texts. I laughed like I haven’t in months I smiled so hard it hurt I was so happy to be talking to S. Our relationship should’ve stayed just a friendship but we were friends so long we took it to the next level and it ended terribly. It’s been almost 6 years since we have broken up. I’ve thought about him and fake texted him a million times. My love for him was strictly on a friendship level and still is I still care deeply for him. Then this morning happened. 

So this morning I woke up around maybe 1400... not that out of the usual for me. Somedays I don’t get out of bed until my SO is about to be home. I texted S asking if we could maybe be friends. He said no but instead of leaving it at that he started attacking me verbally. I took deep breaths and told him I respected his decision. Honestly I’m not hurt about that. I am disappointed but it’s been so long without him I am okay I don’t feel like I’m missing anything. So I continue with my day. 

This past week my SOs little brother has been with us. So I’ve been cooking home cooked dinners each night and letting them play video games while I clean, do laundry, take care of the baby, and cook. I’ve been silent for the most part and pretty well behaved. Today I made scalloped potatoes, steamed broccoli, three rib eye steaks, and honey crescents. No thankyou. No that was delicious. No gratitude. Nothings. They didn’t even do dishes they’re still out on the counter. 

It was 2130 so I said ok it’s time to get ready for bed. They rush in to the bedroom and said no no we have to finish this video game. They turned on the tv and it was a brand new soccer match 0000! I said hell no it’s bed time and turned off the tv. I walked out and they turned it on again so I unplugged everything and threw the controllers in to the closet. They locked me out of the room with the baby. With. The. Baby. Now I’m pissed because I take care of her 24/7!!!!! When he is home it’s his turn. So I walked away from her....

I went into the bathroom started a bath and I’m still in the bath almost 3 hours later. I realized I haven’t had any me time since before our daughter was born 14 months ago. My daughters screaming so my SO runs out to get her and asks wth I’m doing so I said taking a bath. In retaliation he goes and puts on my show in the living room and blasts it so I don’t have peace or quiet. He’s in the bedroom playing his video games. I can hear our daughter crying because she’s tired and hungry (breastfed) so I y’all at them to give her a bottle of formula - stashed free samples from the hospital just in case of emergencies. SO called me a selfish brat for locking myself into the bathroom. 

2300 rolls around... he finds the key to the bathroom and turns on the light. He accuses me of hiding his phone. He has our crying daughter on him as he yells at me. I said I don’t know where it is because our daughter hides our stuff all of the time. He says I’m childish and acting like a brat. I said whatever. I said why don’t you ever care why I’m upset why is everything about you? And he scoffed at me saying I’m only mad because they played video games instead of getting ready for bed. I said no. He said is it because S didn’t want to be friends with you I said no. I said why don’t you look deeper in to my actions and words and find out why I’m upset? He said just tell me. I said no you’re being lazy. He said you’re always calling me names and coming up with excuses. I said not true. He walked out and said whatever you’re a brat. 

Haven’t talked since. I’ve been very vocal to him in the past about being depressed. I’ve even told him straight out I’m not happy anymore. He doesn’t care. He just carries on like I don’t matter. He complains that I don’t do anything all day. He complains that he has to get up at 0730 to go to work. He complains that he has to stay up with me so I can pump with him (because that’s when I am the most depressed). He complains that we only do what I want to do and I’m bossy (not true). 

I’m really lost here. I don’t want to give up on our relationship but I just don’t have any fight left in me so I’m quiet. I feel like I’m just washing out in to the deep sea and no one will miss me. I’m tired of being the only one who cares. I cook I clean I breast feed I feel like I’m doing everything yet it’s all nothing because I don’t wake up to go to work.

acciochilipepper,"I thought I had postpartum depression but the behavioral therapist/dr diagnosed me with adjustment disorder with depression. Basically I need to resolve a bunch of issues before I can start feeling better, but it’s all in my hands and I’m in complete control. I know this should make me feel better but I don’t. I still feel ill equipped. I still can’t think straight, I guess that’s less of a hormonal thing and more because of sleep deprivation.

I mean what do you do when your prescription is to fulfill your basic needs? Should I just tell my baby to stop waking up at night and go to bed hungry? Night wean him? Put him in a crib crying in the daytime so I can go be alone in another room and recharge my introverted self?

ACJ79,"The other morning I was trying to feed my 8 month old twins. My daughter kept wanting things from my husband. I guess I appeared frustrated because I was trying to get her those things so he could get ready for work. 

Later that morning he texted me randomly and asked me if our daughter was still “bugging me”. 

This text upset me because I am suffering from PPD/PPA which I have told him. I have told him I do not want my current mental state to effect our children and that I am doing my best to get through each day. The thought that my child would be “bugging me” bothers me. What bothers me more is that I have repeatedly told him I am not in good shape mentally. 

Do you think that text was a jab at me? He has not been supportive, he’s actually a big part of the problem. If he truly cared wouldn’t he say something different like “are you okay, it seems like (our daughter) was getting to you this morning” or something.

Babislug,"I believe I am experiencing PPD. I started seeing a therapist when my son was only 3 mos old and brought up the topic with her then, and at that time she stated that it was early for me to be saying that and PPD usually surfaces at about 6mos postpartum. I’ve seen her regularly since then (about every 6 weeks) and each time she sees me she suggests a bunch of reading or self care exercises. It’s a lot to take on when I have two little ones at home ... I’ve not been able to make time for that like I should. 

Now I have a 1yo (well, he’s turning 1 next week) and a 2.5yo, and I’m feeling overwhelmed 100% of the time. I’m drowning in laundry, dishes, cleaning ... it’s all I can do to get them ready and drop them off at daycare in the morning. Then I delay picking them up because I don’t want to be alone with them. My toddler is so very needy right now, constantly asking for things or whining to get what he wants. My younger son is so very clingy and will cry if I try to put him down or hand him off to daddy. I’m off for summer right now (I’m a teacher) but I don’t feel like I’m getting the rest I need to be able to handle the coming school year as a mother of 2 super needy little ones.

My husband seems to be pulling away, and I’m not managing this very well. He’s communicating less, helping me less, getting frustrated easily with the kids just like I am. I am constantly upset with him about something, but when I try and talk with him about this I feel like I can’t identify exactly what needs to change. 

I feel so tired all the time. I’m not sleeping well, I’ve had a strange appetite for months (either not hungry and skipping meals, or else ravenous and snacking all day long). I am reading the texts this therapist recommended but they don’t seem to be helping. I don’t have the energy or desire to do the self care things she suggests. I don’t like spending time with my kids ... I just want out, really.

RedheadBunBun,"My daughter is almost 5 months old now and I think I have been dealing with PPD since bringing her home. I had a difficult run in high school where I self-harmed for 5 years, but after meeting my now husband it has been off and on throughout our 9 years together. Honestly, every time there has been a slip-up I have never told him. Just a few weeks ago, during the 4 month sleep regression, there was a night where I just completely broke down. I yelled at our daughter and put her on the bed, ran out of the room and beat my arm against a door frame. The only way I was able to compose myself afterwards was to self-harm (which my husband does not know about). Since then I have done it two more times. I saw my doctor finally, but only mentioned thoughts of self-harm. She prescribed Zoloft for me and then after 4 days I stopped producing milk. That made me feel even worse, so I stopped taking the medication. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I probably need to open up to someone, but it is so ingrained in me to not. Even in high school I kept it from my family for those entire 5 years, and I've never received any positive interactions from anyone when discussing it. And with this being such a difficult time right now, I'm honestly just thinking to myself to go ahead and doing it. Since quitting my job and becoming a stay-at-home-mom my entire day is tending to her. Neither my husband or I get time to ourselves to relax or do the things we use to enjoy, so I end up feeling depressed and tightly wound all day. I feel like self-harm is the only thing I have for that immediate release. Unfortunately my husband is just as stressed now that he is solely responsible for us financially; I really can't open up to him about this and have him worried about me even more than he already is. I understand I've gone through times like this before, and it has passed. Does that sound terrible? Has anyone else struggled like this before?

concernedhusbnd,"My wife of 5 years wants a divorce.  Our daughter is 2.  

She had a hard time breastfeeding, and it took a major toll on her when her supply ran out.  
She went from being the most responsible, caring, loving person to an angry, short tempered asshole in what seemed like overnight.
I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her for the longest time.

About a year and ago, my wife started line dancing to get out of the house and get some exercise. She found a great, supportive community of female friends she’d never really had before.  I was assured it was a “girls thing” and not to worry about anything.  “This type of dancing was technical, not sexual.”

I didn’t think twice that she was out until 2am 4 nights a week, because she said it made her happy and she felt “whole” again.

She would talk about how much guilt she would feel for wanting to do this for herself.  How she felt judged by people when she would tell them she went out at night.  I couldn’t protest, for fear that I would add to that guilt by expressing any concerns I may have as a husband.  

Fast forward to a month ago and she tells me she doesn’t love me anymore, and has feelings for a guy she dances with.  Said she “could pretend like she was another person” with him. 

I am blindsided.  Her family and friends are shocked.

We went to couples counseling, but she started it off by saying she does not want to salvage the relationship.  Therapist took her at her word and we talked about scheduling and calendars the entire time we saw him, until he finally told us we didn’t need him anymore.

The hardest part in all of this, has been our day to day relationship.  It’s never been better.  
It was like a giant cloud had been lifted off of her shoulders.  
We can talk to each other again, and laugh.  
But it hasn’t changed the way she feels.

Now that this is all in the open, I am cognizant of my own shortcomings in the relationship, and have been very vocal in my desire to better myself not just for her, but for me as well.  I want to do the work.  

She does not. 

No matter how great it has been between us, and how much love and support I give and show her, she still wants to remain separated, and to be with this other person.

I felt out of my body and out of control of everything around me. The guilt, shame and loneliness was too overwhelming. I am an experienced yoga practitioner, in a more traditional sense. I worked my way back into a practice and I’m still trying to find a daily practice. I also, see a therapist and a physiologist and take medication. My situation was severe and even almost two years later I struggle a bit. My reactions to things that happen, my thoughts. I know it takes time. Anyways, my question is I think I’m at a point to hold a discussion yoga group around PPD similar to how a yoga group is done with AA, would you find this helpful? I teach yoga normally (prenatal/postnatal, addiction, yin &amp; vinyasa) and I’ve spent many hours putting this together, I truly want to help others and it helps me heal as well.

max_gooph,"My cousin gave birth to a girl February of this year. She lives in Las Vegas NV, which is about 7 hours away from me. She was putting up weird Facebook statuses, such as “when will this end?”, “just as it starts to get better it gets even worse”.  I reached out to her and she told me that she feels miserable and nothing makes her happy ever since she got pregnant. I know that the pregnancy was unexpected but they welcomed their daughter with open arms and the baby daddy and her even got married and have plans to buy a house. She is usually very happy and goofy and loved going to the gym, so I know it’s serious if she upright says nothing makes her happy. She says she has no insurance and they can’t afford a lot of the doctor/therapist prices out there. How can I help her? What can I say? Or does anyone know of any free/cheap resources in Nevada she could use?

Tinyjalepeno,"So I’m curious about some things and I just want to state I have realized I know very little on postpartum depression so I apologize if I sound naive, ignorant, or offensive to anyone with the questions I have. 

I am curious as to how common postpartum depression is? If it is something that must be diagnosed specifically as a mental illness or something like you have been feeling down since having a baby so you can say it’s postpartum? Does it vary? Is it something that some women throw around lightly? And so sorry if that sounds offensive, but I’m curious if some people treat it lightly as people did with add or adhd. So many people claim to have add or adhd, but in reality they were never diagnosed and really don’t have either they just get distracted and want to say they have add or adhd. I’m curious if a woman who feels blue for a week after pregnancy could say she suffered from post partum? Or is that just simply not the case with post partum? 

I hope my questions don’t offend anyone, but honestly at the moment I don’t have insurance (have to wait till November to activate) so I can’t go to the doctors to be fully informed just yet. I realize my knowledge on this is severely lacking and once again hope I do not offend anyone, but these are serious questions I’ve been thinking about lately. I’m a tad bit scared to have children because I feel like I hear about post partum constantly... any info would be amazing.",Postpartum_Depression,Would like information on postpartum depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/bzk3kc/would_like_information_on_postpartum_depression/,1560322798.0,2019-06-11 23:59:58,
neodanam86,"I had my beautiful, perfect son in March, but I'm so unhappy.


I feel so guilty; on the outside I probably have everything a mom/person could want. My well behaved gorgeous son, a well paying job to go back to (2.5 days away), an attentive dad to our son who loves me too, a nice apartment...trouble is I just don't feel happy at all. 


I wake up miserable (whatever number of hours I've slept) and sit alone all day with my newborn, half the time trying to get up the motivation to get him ready and get outside of my apartment - which although it's big, inexpensive (for New York state) and homey - feels like a prison to me. I feel so alone. My boyfriend works nights so we rarely see each other, and when he leaves for work at 9:30 anxiety fills me up. I hate, hate, hate being here alone - but there's no helping it. He has to make money. My boyfriend also has always had intimacy issues so the time we have together is sparsely sprinkled with the kind of kisses you give your grandmother and a tiny amount of touching, prior to last week we hadn't had sex in 5 months. I cry practically every day because I feel he doesn't find me attractive, never did, and never will. When we had sex it was of course rushed. I didn't even get to look at his body and he barely touched me. I realize we have a child now, but sex is one thing that keeps me sane and I can't even have any.


I'm on the verge of vomiting from anxiety of going back to work. I have worked for my current company for 6 years and they have walked all over me the entire time. When we discussed coming back they told me I could cut my hours, then when I said I wanted to they promptly told me it wasn't an option. In the past I have been bullied to the point of tears and told I could not go to an important therapy appointment because my supervisor wasn't there (that caused me to discontinue treatment). I asked to please take days off preemptively for my son's doctors appointments and they said no to that as well. My boyfriend simply says, ""find a new job, it will be easy for you"" but to me it feels like the most daunting task imaginable - I put in applications and then hope and pray that they won't call me. 


I have almost no support outside of my boyfriend. My mom helped me around the time I gave birth but for the most part that has gone out the window. She can only do anything in a specific time frame and she never offers. I recently had a falling out with a ""friend"" who offered to help me, but she was a constant disappointment blowing me off at every turn only to then turn on me, saying I was delusional and a terrible person. It ended with her telling me to fuck off, that I should never have had a child, and to lose her number - that one fucked me up for days - I'm still not completely over it. I can't really ask most of my other friends for help, I have too much guilt to make myself do so. I've always done everything alone.

Then there's breast feeding. My baby was given a bottle so early and started having trouble latching I gave it up. I've been pumping since, and I got good results in the beginning, then I got my period and it's trickled to an ounce per session. I feel like such a failure because I can't even make enough milk for one feeding at a time and I have no back stock for when I go back to work. I also desperately miss actually breast feeding - I know I kind of blame my boyfriend for this subconsciously - but I know he was onlubtrying to help me since I was in so much pain. Now I hate pumping and my nipples hurt every day. I'm putting off pumping as I write this even though my breasts are heavy and uncomfortable.


There are nights where I lose my temper and then worry that my son will be fucked up because I cry, sob and scream around him. I feel so much guilt. I look at him and see the most perfect child in the world, and can't help loving him more than anything in this world. I don't sleep well because I'm so afraid he will die when I'm sleeping. I was able to sleep mornings up until now, but I will return to work soon (normal hours so no sleeping in) and I'm worried about being too scared to sleep.


All in all I feel so lost and scared. I know with time some of the issues will resolve with time, and I definitely have been contemplating therapy but it still feels hopeless. I never thought I would feel this way when I had a baby, but I do.

Kalldaro,"I'm a stay at home mom with a three month old and a 6 year old and 4 year old. My husband often works late.

Ever since the kids got out if school I feel overwhelmed. My four year old is having trouble adjusting to his new sibling and he has been acting up. And he did not do that prior to the new baby. He kept knocking things over today and one was a TV dinner table and a glass shattered.

We recently found out that he is partially deaf and he got tubes in his ear. He had been getting speech therapy for years with little to know improvement. After the surgery he's been saying more words. But it's so hard to work with him because the baby constantly wants to be held. I tried a sling but when he gets excited he flails his arms and I have to protect my daughter.

I don't think I have ppd but I think it might be developing. I had it with a previous pregnancy and some of those feelings are coming back.

I tried to get help with my mom. But she just laughs and says that all moms go through this.  Last time when I had ppd, I asked for help and she said that she couldn't because that would would be enabling me.

I just feel so alone and I feel like there is no help out there. And I wish my mom was like other moms who would take any chance they could get to spend time with their grandchildren.

absolll,"I have dealt with anxiety/depression/ADD my whole life. I've done a ton of therapy and been on medication for a few years. I've suffered from alcoholism and addiction. I've been clean and sober for over a year now, and it has been quite an eventful year. I got sober and found out 2 months later I was 6 weeks pregnant. My daughter was born at 30 weeks after an emergency c-section due to placental abruption. She stayed in the NICU for 49 days before coming home with us.

I love my daughter, I am amazed at how far she has come. However, recently I have been contemplating asking my sister to just take her, adopt her from me. In my heart I know I don't want to give her up, but I just can't shake this feeling. The last few days I have felt like dying. When I drive, I imagine being hit by another car. Tonight I was wondering what pills we had in the house. I was also getting ready to write a will. I know I do not actually want to die. I have worked so hard for the life I have.

crazytownpopulation1,"I do not have Postpartum but I do live with 
severe depression. My cousin’s wife died last night and we believe it was a direct result of Postpartum. She was 24 and always so great to me and my family. My dad died in January and she sent beautiful messages to me and was always so sweet. She was like a hippie flower child full of optimism. At least on the surface. 

She stopped coming around family gatherings and I found out that she had not been very nice to my cousin since their baby boy had been born. She had also taken to being mean to his two daughters that he has full custody of and that she used to be amazing with. She’s a big reason why he has full custody because she supported him and stood by him through all of the court battles. However, after the birth, she became physically and emotionally abusive towards my cousin. 

He loved her so much. He fought for her in every sense of he word. He tried so hard to get her to see a counselor, to go to family counseling, to stop drinking and using pills (she had a drinking problem when they met and they both stopped drinking for years... I didn’t find out about the pills until today). Not long ago he reached out to find a divorce lawyer. And I know it killed him. He’s been through so much but he had finally got his family, his amazing job, and everything was going great... until it wasn’t. 

Last night she was out drinking. He went to pick her up and take her home so she was safe. He put her to bed and went to the couch. He went back to check on her a little while later and she was not breathing. He tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We don’t know yet if she asphyxiated or overdosed. I just can’t imagine what those girls and my cousin are going through. Their son is too young and it probably won’t effect him as much, but the girls have been through so much between their absent mother and then pending divorce. 

So I want to show my support and help in any ways that I can. I’ve always tried to watch for signs in my friends because I know the symptoms are the same as depression. If you know of any good charities to give to that support this cause, please share. 

And as someone on the outside, please reach out. If I would have known the extent of it, I would have tried to talk to her about it. I didn’t know until they agreed on a divorce. I know it’s hard to reach out, I have a hard time taking care of myself when it gets really bad. Just know that people out there love you and want you to take care of yourself.

I would say my moodiness started last week when my husband mentioned something about the house not being clean.  It started a huge fight and was crying and saying how all these expectations are unreasonable.

This week I really messed up, I am on maternity leave and decided to sign into my work emailed see what was going on.  I saw an email addressed to me and I flipped out and included my director.  I saw a lot of changes happening in the company and it just caused me to feel really out of control.  It was causing me so much anxiety, I was getting insomnia. I definitely offended people with my emails and got a scathing email back from my director.

Then I started getting really weepy and crying about it.  I've since sent another email apologizing and letting them know my postpartum period has been difficult.

jessmayfish,"My little bub turned one week old today. FTM. I had a pretty crappy labour. I was Induced at 40 weeks due to high blood pressure, induction caused intense contractions but slow dilation, 37 hour labour, baby position back-to-back, almost had c-section, gave birth in theater room via episiotomy and VE birth. Bub ended up with a skin tear on the top of her head from the vacuum. She is okay now, but it caused her to have a fairly high level of jaundice. I ended up with two stitches, and a nasty hemorrhoid which is making my life hell.

I just want to know when everything feels “normal” again? I know my life will never be the same, but I am barely coping. I feel like a dairy cow trapped in the house running on less than 2 hours sleep a day. I absolutely love my little girl, most the time I think she’s perfect. But I feel like I’m mourning my old life. I miss freedom. I miss sleeping for more then 2-3 hours. Because of bub’s jaundice she needs to be feed every 3 hours max with boob and then a bottle top up, so my husband can’t help too much. I’m so angry that he is getting 6-7 hours sleep  most nights. I’m so goddamn tired. I try sleeping during the day when I can, but between frequent feedings and pumping, it’s so damn hard.

greatwhitekoala,"My daughter is almost 3 months old. Lately I’ve been feeling like she doesn’t love me the way a child should love their mother. I breastfeed and pump every so often just for when she goes to my moms which is about once a week. When she’s home with me she’s not a miserable baby but she’s definitely not happy, I get some smiles and coos but have never made her laugh. When she’s with my mom she laughs and smiles constantly, I’m happy that she’s happy but honestly it hurts my feelings a little that I can never make her that happy. When she spends the day with my mom and then comes back to me she usually cries for about 30 min straight and also refuses to latch. She doesn’t like to snuggle with me or when I give her kisses. She doesn’t look for me when someone else is holding her and she never cries when I leave. She sleeps better when I put her in her crib in the other room other than next to my bed. 
     The first night in the hospital my mom stayed with me and held her for most of the night because I was so tired from 22 hours of labor and because she was so excited to be a grandma, but I feel like that may have made my daughter bond with her instead of me and maybe thinks that’s her mother.

MajesticAioli,"My sister has always struggled with depression. I was worried for her through her pregnancy when she had to go off her medication. Things got really rough, but we all supported her and she got through it. She had all the best intentions of doing what she could to avoid PPD, knowing she was at a higher risk. As a first time mom, she struggled with breast feeding and he had trouble latching, which gave her blisters and it became too painful. I think this started the PPD, she felt like she was poisoning him by giving him formula and cried about it a lot. 

Another trigger is that they only have friends out there, the closest family members are 4,000-6,000 miles away. The family would love to help if they were closer, but the friends, most of them childless, are less willing to help out, which leaves her feeling trapped and alone. They live in one of the most expensive cities in the US and while her husband has a good job, he's been working a lot of extra shifts so that she can work fewer shifts and stay home with their son; daycare isn't an option due to high costs.  She has expressed how she feels like she's trapped at home all the time with her son. Due to the shifts her husband works and the nature of his job, her son (6 months) also doesn't sleep through the night because she doesn't let him cry it out, instead she soothes him  within 5 minutes of him crying, she's on very little sleep because if this. 

Over the last few weeks, our text conversations have grown darker (on her end). I try to change her perspective on how she sees thing, but it's of no use. Last week, I finally got our parents involved and asked them to reach out to her husband, because while claiming she had spoke to him about her concerns and that ""he doesn't"" care"", typically means she brushed the surface of her concerns and he didn't think it was a big deal; she's always been like that, we always have to encourage her to let it all out. Plus he's very caring and to hear him brushing it off didn't sound like he was given the full picture. 

She had been telling me things like, ""my son is better off without me, his daddy will take great care of him"", to which I pointed out he struggles to handle him when she has her two 4 hour shifts every week. He's not a bad dad, he's just nervous and also a first time parent. He also has BPD that gets really bad if he's stressed and has little sleep, and I also tried to point this out, that if he has an episode, no one will be there for their son (legitimately my mom would fly out there to help, but I wanted her to see the bigger picture). She also said things like, ""If I wasn't such a chicken about killing myself, I'd be dead right now"" and "" All I think about is killing myself all day long"". I guess I just assumed it was all talk. 

Yesterday morning, she sent text messages to myself and our other sister. I don't know if they were intended to be cries for help, or to pass on a message to her son when he was older, but she knew I don't usually check my phone until my break at 9:40am and that our other sister starts work a lot later and wouldn't see it right away. Who knows if she was even thinking about this when she sent it. Her message came in at 6:24 am and I noticed an alert and read the message at 6:27, only because I never get messages that early, and felt like it was off. 

My sister's text messages informed me that she had taken all the pills in their apartment and was waiting to die and to tell her son she loved him more than anything in the world. (I knew it had to be real because she had trouble typing it and even autocorrect couldn't figure it out). And this is where I feel like I failed her: I should have thought to get up, go to somewhere quiet and call the police in her city. Instead I took a screenshot and messaged my dad and mom (they would both be up then) and her husband (he was working). THEN I thought to call the police but I didn't want to confuse them or delay it, and figured the 3 no responses I got from them were because they were handling the situation. As it turns out none of them saw it, they all received my text by 6:28am. My dad saw it at 6:45am and turned around to go back home. My other sister got up at 7am, saw it and called the police in their city. I feel like she was unresponsive for so long because I didn't react the way I should have. 

I know I shouldn't be beating myself up over this, but it's hard not to feel partially at blame. I feel like everyone involved probably privately feels the same way about my actions. Other thoughts that crossed my mind when I thought about calling were (1)  I wouldn't have been able to clearly state the issue to them from balling my eyes out, (2)  I would have been so eerily calm about it that it wasn't taken seriously. And finally, (3)  I thought about how she's an adult and will they even listen to me, I mean when adults run away and you report them missing, they tell you there's not much that can be done about it because adults can make their own decisions. 

My biggest fear is that she will have some type of lasting condition that could have been avoided if I reacted differently, when in all actuality she caused it in the first place.  

My mom is with them now, her son slept through the whole ordeal, EMS arrived in time, she is alive. She was in a coma for 26 hours in the Cardiac ICU. Initially when she woke up, she didn't recognize anyone, but now she's talking and eating.

I still struggle, things are better, I change diapers, I feed, I play, the guilt isn’t so awful, the depression isn’t so weighing. But I HATE being touched by them during my “relax” moments. They’re kids. They want their mom. They climb me. But I literally detest it. 
My husband doesn’t understand when I ask him to grab them off me. They don’t get it when I shout for them to go play instead of being on me. But I literally can’t handle it. Im afraid of the rage I have when they touch me and I don’t want it.

She asked if I were plotting or planning to hurt him and I firmly explained that I was not and that wasn’t the case at all. I don’t want to hurt my baby. I have no desire to.

Tsiprasisamalaka,"I just need to vent.

My daughter is 15 months old and I’ve been trying to deal with PPD on my own since she was born. Its a long story, but I like in a different country in a tiny village and if I got help for it, everyone would find out and its not accepted as a real thing and I’d be the crazy person of the village.

I’m struggling so hard. My mantra since day 1 has been it will get easier soon. Days and days have gone by and its only getting harder. I’m 25 and feel like I’m 60. I literally don’t know if my daughter is just the worst, most difficult child in the world or if thats how I’m perceiving her. Sometimes I feel like she HATES ME! When my husband babysits her when I’m teaching and I come home she starts screaming because she obviously prefers my husband. Sometimes when she screams I want to scream at the top of my lungs. I’d be lying if I said I’ve never screamed or completely lost it and bawled my eyes out. 

And then she comes over all upset and goes “mama?” And strokes my head and kisses me and I feel terrible for being such a mess of a mother. 

This morning I actually had the worst thought and I think I must be the only person in the whole world who could possibly think something like this. My daughter is sick with a runny nose and cough, and sometimes she coughs so bad that she throws up. It was 5 am and I heard her coughing violently in her sleep and this thought just randomly came to mind like, “if she throws up and chokes and no one realizes, I’d get a divorce and have my life back.” Immediately I got up and sure enough, she was on the verge of throwing up, which I helped her with because I promise I DO LOVE MY DAUGHTER!

I lay awake at night thinking about my daughter and how she’s going to grow up and when that happens, I won’t be able to protect her anymore. I cry thinking about how I’m going to die and leave her alone in the world. 

I never expected to be a mom and I feel like I’m mourning the life that I used to have. All of my friends want to go out and party and don’t seem to understand how much having a child has changed my life. My mom was a drug addict and an alcoholic and it really fucked me up. I don’t ever want to be like she was so I don’t really want to go out with any of my friends anymore. 

I’m a SAH mom but I still work from home which is really overwhelming. I feel like I never get time to relax because I’m constantly taking care of my baby, doing chores, and keeping up with my job. I feel so lonely, the only adult contact I have on most days is with my boyfriend who doesn’t even like me anymore. Our relationship was on the rocks before I got pregnant and now that the baby is here, we’ve grown so distant, I feel like we’re strangers. Our lease is up in September so I think we’re going to call it quits and go our separate ways. To be able to afford a home, I’m going to have to move out of state or move back in with my parents. 

Everything sucks right now and I just don’t feel capable of handling any of it. This morning, I put in earplugs so I could sleep without being woken up by my daughter crying.

She is a germaphobe and I have been ok living with her up until today. While I was making dinner in the kitchen and I was handling 3 pots at the same time. One is soup, one is boiling water to cook noodle and another one is fried egg. To finish up the soup, I went to the fridge to get a bowl of precut vegetables to be added into the soup. She got very upset because:

1. I did not rinse the vegetables before putting them into the soup. 
2. While I was putting the vegetables into the soup, the bowl was hovering over the skillet with fried eggs. 
3. I did not follow her instructions. She told me to put the fried eggs on dining table once it is done but I didn’t. 

She later said she does not want to eat any of those because the dishes are dirty/contaminated. She also questioned my ability to follow her instructions and asking why I ignore her instructions. 

I snapped. I have had enough. I threw the pot with hot water on the kitchen floor, saying that I’m not going to do anything anymore. I also mentioned that she needs help with her OCD.

Am I ever going to feel the same way I used to about them? ,Postpartum_Depression,Dogs after having a baby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/b4slwr/dogs_after_having_a_baby/,1553428163.0,2019-03-24 04:49:23,
deadblinger,"I (22F) gave birth to my first baby at 17 weeks (16 gestation). I can’t do anything anymore. It’s a daily struggle to brush my teeth or get out of bed or do anything worth while. Its been over a month but nothing has changed. It seems to only be getting worse. 

A little backstory, I met my s/o the last week of September 2018 and I found out I was pregnant Nov. 19th of 2018, after being in a car accident and sent to the hospital. We moved in together in Dec. of 2018. We left VA and drove to CO the first day of February to be with his family as we both were clueless on how to start a family and I didn’t have any to lean on. His family are wonderful, considerate, kind people but he grew up vastly different than I. Both of his parents are married and in love, he is wholly supported as well as his other siblings and I have never seen my parents in the same room nor been supported by them. 
Two weeks after knowing his parents, a few months knowing my s/o we lost our baby. 

My boyfriend is a great person. During my pregnancy he did (quite literally) everything I asked. During birth he was incredibly strong. Amongst other things, I often feel discredited when I say I gave birth because my baby wasn’t full term. But none the less, it was the most traumatic and terrifying thing I have ever been through. 

A month later and all I do is imagine putting little baby arms in her clothes and what she would be playing with or how tired I would be. I mix our faces together and come up with a million faces that could be hers. I wonder what fads she would fall into and what fashion choices she would choose as a teenager. I daydream about sending her off to school and how it would be the perfect school. 
I dream about touching her, something I never got to do. 

I got no answers from my doctors. I have no reason of why she passed. 
I left the hospital friday and Monday as I was headed to the funeral home to pick out an urn, my doctor called my saying my HIV test came back inconclusive. 
I had to get additional testing to confirm if i was positive or negative. I cried for ever. I thought “oh my god i’ve killed my baby and i’ve ruined my boyfriends life.” 
Everything felt like my fault. I just knew she died because of that night i gave in and drank a vanilla coke. or it’s because i accidentally stood next to a microwave that one time. or because i made the decision to move in hopes i could give everyone a better life. or because somehow i infected her with HIV. 

I was paranoid for days until my tests came back. but days felt like years. i was going crazy. every time my phone rang every time i heard one tiny sound. 

my test results came back negative. i wrote off that obgyn and all the bad experiences i had with them and i tried to move past it. 

only i cant, i have such bad anxiety and paranoia i cant do anything but get angry and my boyfriend and cry and want to leave, but he wont let me. 

i have the constant feeling that something terrible is going to happen and i have nothing to do but wait, and i have the undying need to care for something, anything. I want my baby back so bad. 

And what hurts the most is while I prayed so hard to God to not be the reason my baby was taken from me, to spare my boyfriends life and health as well as mine I found solace in having a reason my baby was gone. 

But now, blessed me, we were all healthy.. I don’t have a reason she left me. And I don’t know how to move on.

midcenturymadame,"I am very confused as I write this. I have my good days, and then I have some bad. I can get snappy, especially when I don’t feel good. When I get migraines it’s especially bad and hard for me to communicate anyways. I’m confused because I wonder..”am I too sensitive, and take things too personally? Do I misinterpret what my husband says?” He’s very helpful around the house, and helps with cleaning and cooking. That I am all very thankful for. However, the way he talks to me and calls me names makes me feel inferior. Even his way of communicating... is it passive? Indirect? He will talk to me while I am cleaning, and say things like “I’m sure K ( our 5 month old) would appreciate a bath.” He says this while standing there holding her, and looking at me while speaking. I get upset, in those moments, because it’s obvious I am doing something, and I’m like, okay.... I’ll stop everything and give her a bath. Then I’ll get up to go start a bath and when he sees I’m upset he will come back saying I’m a bitch and that he will do it himself.  So, in a similar scenario yesterday, something went down and I’m still trying to maneuver through the frustrations of it all. My husband made dinner, after I told him I still had a migraine. We all ate and the kids made a disaster with food all over the floor so I got down to clean it all up. I was under the table wiping up spaghetti and I hear him say, “I’m sure K would appreciate some food.” I couldn’t keep it in so I snapped back ,”I’m sure she would!” And he got all mad. I explained that it’s upsetting that I’m cleaning up a mess and if he wants the baby to eat he should feed her.” He got so pissed. The other kids were needy too. After calling me a cunt and yelling fuck you guys he slammed the door and went for a smoke. We didn’t really talk all evening and I couldn’t even make eye contact. So I should apologize for snapping? I said sorry last time this kind of thing happened and he never apologizes for the names he calls me, or for the way he reacts. I don’t even want to talk to him. I wonder if he will initiate a conversation or just ignore what happens like what he usually does. If he does say sorry about anything he says “we were both tired.” I’m so tangled in this. Idk.

But a lot of the time I don’t want to. And I hate saying that. I love my son; he’s the sweetest baby. I breastfeed, cloth diaper; I do everything I can for him as a stay at home mom. I never feel that it’s good enough. I feel as though I have to force myself to go through life. And for months I’ve been fighting off the feeling that I should just give up on it. On everything. I’ve tried talking to my husband about the way I feel and he just doesn’t know what to do. I don’t know what steps to take to help myself. There’s so much going on in my life that’s hurting me and dragging me back into what feels like an empty void. And the anxiety is just as bad. My mind keeps coming up with scenarios in which someone I care about or myself could get hurt with every action I take. Or my mind will make me paranoid to what is going on in other people’s minds. And I can’t control it. I have noticed myself taking up nervous habits like rubbing my fingers or my forearm until they are raw. The anxiety has gotten so bad that I can’t drive anymore. I don’t know what steps to take to help myself get better. I’m just so tired. And I want some help. I’ve been scaring myself lately with the thought of it being easier to just not be here anymore.

I haven't gotten a night of sleep for months. I'm starting to hate him. I didn't get a chance to see him for 3 days after he was born. All my family got to see him and touch him first. The only time he doesnt cry is when my mom holds him.

I spent my entire pregnancy scrambling and working 16 hour days to be able to buy needed crap for him when he came home. As well as moving twice. First to leave his crap dad and then to a new house with my mom.

All he does is cry and gruggle. I'm still trying to pump since breastfeeding wasn't going well. My output is terrible. All I do is feed him change him  wash bottles and pump just to turn around a d do it all over again. While in the 20 minutes he isn't crying or sleeping I'm trying to clean this pigsty house because my mom is incapable of cleaning after herself and try to study for nursing school so I don't have to be broke af for the rest of my shit life

I'm so done with all this crqp. I want to give him up for adoption but his crap father won't terminate rights so here I am trying to do all this on my own. Giving him to crap dad isn't an option he's a drug addict 

I just want to sleep. And preferably never wake up again

zack0404,"So I don’t know exactly where to turn at this point but I have such a crazy story that I hope this is the right forum to post this issue in. I’ll also try relationship advice but I’m I’m desperate right now, and hope that some mothers can help me understand and maybe even help me realize if my situation is wrong or right. 

The story: I’m a 21 year old Male who has been dating a 22 year old woman since she was 4 months pregnant. We were friends for a little before I knew she was pregnant and I figured I could look past it and begin a relationship with her. I stepped into a situation I may not have fully understood. Her Baby’s father is not around so ever since I came around she has looked at me and viewed me and the father. I since have backed down from calling myself the father because I realized it wasn’t healthy for the child for him to think I was his dad. I was there when her son was born around 7 months ago and have been here ever since, but calling me dad was a mistake in my opinion since we aren’t married and I don’t support him financially in anyway. When I was “dad” anything I did was wrong and I felt as though me working hard for them was being taken for granted. I stepped into this situation, but after being here she wasn’t grateful she accepted things from me that I wasn’t able to do. I’m a college student and my mother and father do not really approve of my relationship due to the responsibility of taking care of a child who I did not bring into this world. My gf wanted me to spend the night and be there with them, but I still live at home and me essentially moving out is not an option. I rely heavily on my mom and dad for things as I am unable to work and go to school right now due to reasons I would rather not share to keep my identity hidden. My girlfriend stopped trying in our relationship for about 3 months. We broke up and have been working on things, but she has issues whenever I go out ever since the baby if she isn’t there too. No matter the situation there is a problem with me being out. I never have had an issue when she goes out and never will. She’s been out twice without me to the bar and I had no problem. I’ve only been out less than 6 times with the baby and 1 of them was with her. Every time I go out without her we argue and she says it’s because of her Postpartum and she’s dealing with trying to accept things like that again. We aren’t able to have a mature adult conversation about it and anytime I express my feelings I feel like she isn’t listening and only listens to argue. We have been trying to fix things and this is one of the last issues we have to fix before I think things can get better, but I don’t wanna be in a situation where I can’t even go out without it being some kind of problem. She gets really rude and disrespectful in arguments with me and I’m frustrated and tired. I love this woman as we’ve been through so much, but I don’t know how long I have to wait or if postpartum is just a crutch to act out. Recently she has had a problem with me going back to a place where I attended my first three years of undergrad for a week. I’m not going there to just party. I have a couple things I need to take care of as far as internships go and as far as some volunteer work goes. She has said we’re single (which we are) and that if she goes out and she dances with guys or flirts it’s ok because of my choice to go somewhere she isn’t comfortable with me going alone. I feel like she doesn’t see my side of things and used her having a baby as a crutch to not hear my side and argue. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m losing my voice and don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong. I don’t know how to get across my side without being insensitive to her life changing event. I love her and her son but I also feel I need to look out for me and my feelings, but every time I try I’m not understanding and not helping her get over this postpartum. I just don’t understand and I don’t know how long it is gonna last it’s been 7 months. It’s especially hard bc I stepped into this situation and have no support from my family so I have nobody to get advice from. I hope this makes sense any help is appreciated and any thoughts would help too. Feel free to ask questions if something doesn’t make sense. I want to answer unbiasedly and to understand.

cynthea12,"I was diagnosed with late onset postpartum depression. My son was 6 months old. I experience anger or complete disconnection primarily when it does kick it. 

When I was diagnosed, I told my husband I needed support and action. I'm the decisive one of us, but when my PPD kicks in, I need him to actually DO SOMETHING. 

This morning, I was hanging with my LO, now 8 months. He was in a really good mood. Then, the cat threw up. Four. Times. Well, got to clean that up, right? Now, LO is screaming in my face while I do this. DH is sleeping because he works third shift. LO is screaming his head off, but it has to be done. 

So I've cleaned two spots and tote everything plus LO to the other two while he continues being a complete asshole baby. DH makes his way downstairs and I give him a brief rundown as I clean. He takes LO, I finish and migrate to the kitchen to put everything away and make a bottle. And then repeat everything I already said because my DH can be a friggin idiot and doesn't listen when I talk. 

On top of this, the friggin cat walks in and he's been meow screaming in my face all morning, so I scream at him. 

DH then rips my head off in an oh so supportive manner. 

And then I call him an effing asshole because, well, read above.

This is going to sound unrelated but I promise it is. In case you couldn't tell I have pretty bad depression and anxiety. 

My mother just finalized her second divorce. All the power to her. He was an abusive pos and I'm glad she's finally out. The shitty thing from this- she is on title of my mortgage with my husband and owes $130 000 in taxes this year because of the payout from her divorce (the total she got was over $1 million but was put into a corporation so she can pay herself as an income). She wanted to sell my house to pay for this. She supposedly had been ""looking into every other possibility and this is the only way!"" She was bought out of the his house with the downpayment for mine. We were all going to move in together- my mom, brother, husband, me, and our kids. We each had our own space since my basement is an in law suite with separate entrance. She decided after 6 months she wanted to get an apartment with her new boyfriend. Okay fine. 

So my kids my husband and I live in the house, my mom and brother move out. She then decides to go to a whole bunch of concerts (3 days out of the country to see various bands. Pretty expensive) and travels to ""get away"" basically every second weekend. So now she owes a ton in taxes because she took out too much and her exhusband put her dividends from his company from 2 years ago so he wouldn't have to pay taxes on it. 

My mom comes to me with this plan of ""we need to sell the house and I need all the money from it"" but I'm a stay at home mom and we literally cannot afford to move. We would end up homeless because we can't rent anything with enough bedrooms in our price range. 

Obviously my husband freaks out, and rightfully so, I was too. So we go to her with several ways to not have to sell the house and eventually we all agree on it. Yay happy ending right? Not exactly.

Because of this apparently irrelevant stress my husband and I basically got wiped out. As soon as he heard she came to me with this selling the house crap he says ""we can't have any more kids. Ever."" We have 3. We planned at least 4 but were willing go up to 6. I'm on birth control and I absolutely agree we need to wait until my mom can be taken off title and paid out or until I have an income (I'm doing home daycare and have 2 kids lined up so far because I can't afford daycare for my kids who are 5, 2, and infant.) He wants to get snipped but i said I'm not ready to close that door. He immediately backed off that BUT has said a few more times we have to be done having kids. 

This was not the plan. I have a very hard time with change. I like things to be worked out and I was so unprepared for this. Even though the thought had crossed my mind too it was still tough to say it and hear it. I feel like everything got messed up because my mom, having the money to pay, doesn't want to pay her income tax. I know I have to talk to my husband about this. It could actually mean divorce for us though and I am terrified of that. I've been crying over this for 3 days and feel completely lost because I know I'm not ready to shut that door. I know I want at least one more baby. 

I look at my infant and cry even more because what if she is my last? I haven't enjoyed it enough and I feel like I messed up by not and I'm just so unprepared for this and I'm scared. I hate this so much. Even though my husband and I have a great relationship and usually talk everything through very thoroughly I'm too scared to come to him with this and have him shut me down. What if I end up resenting him if we don't have more?

ButterflyWriter,"I'm 4 months postpartum and am feeling a little lost. Recently I shared something on Facebook which really really struck a cord with me and put exactly how I was feeling into words. I won't post the entire thing cuz it was pretty long but basically it was saying that nobody prepares you for not having your baby inside you. it says your body after you have a baby feels like a stranger because everything is like different with extra skin, extra marks and saggy boobs and such like that. It really spoke to me because for the last four months people have been asking me how I feel and I've just been saying all I'm fine or I just feel different and nobody could understand what I meant even I didn't know what I meant. So when I read that article I realized it was saying exactly what I was feeling and I felt a little better so I shared it. Well in sharing it one of my husband's Aunts felt the need to comment on it and make a snide remark along the lines of ""I never had to worry about that I just looked at my baby cuz I knew why my body looked the way it did."" I don't know why but this really hurt my feelings because for once I was actually putting my feelings out there in a subtle way and for somebody to just basically make it sound like I was some selfish person who only cared that they didn't look like some tight, toned, skinny little thing anymore it made me feel like shit for even sharing something like that. if this isn't the right place to post as I apologize I just haven't been able to find a community in which I could speak my feelings about being postpartum.

Anyway, I'm tired of this. I'm on depression medication. I see a therapist (when I can actually get a babysitting and can keep an appointment to go).

Justsitstilldammit,"I’m a mom of a 2.5 year and 7 month old who I really can not complain about. I have the teaching job I always wanted and loved until this, my 7th year. My husband is amazing and does more than his share of the work that goes into running this household.

Up until this fall, I felt confident and happy, like any challenge I took on was manageable. In fact, I liked being busy!

My son was born in May and my maternity leave lasted until October. It went great and I was lucky to have so much time. Between then and now I feel I’ve become a somewhat different person. I thought I was just handling the stress of a new baby and going back to work a little less gracefully than usual.

Much happened between Oct-Dec, but we all kept telling ourselves to just “make it to winter break!” It was the first day back Tuesday and after school, in the middle of telling my mom a funny story from the day, I started bawling and literally didn’t stop until I fell asleep around 11 PM. That’s when I knew something was wrong and I needed to ask for major help.

In retrospect, there were a LOT of red flags, but again, I just thought it was me not being as efficient. I could go on about the feelings and mood swings and anxiety, but my question is this:

What strategies have worked for you in the interim between starting Zoloft and it being in your system fully? If it takes weeks or months to feel “normal” how do you cope? I certainly have to return to work soon, so what if I panic? What if I’m needed and can’t do it? How do I do my job and care for my family in even the most basic way if I can’t even muster the energy to get dressed sometimes?

I feel like if I had a plan for those difficult moments so I can still function in the meantime until I genuinely feel up to it, it would make this process seem manageable.

Some days I drive my bf to work so that I get out with the baby, since it's hard for me to leave most of the time. We had a plan ahead of time, but at the last minute I panicked- thinking for sure he would be late, I needed to nurse first, it was pathetic that I needed him to get me out, etc. He reassured me though and we went on our way. And it was actually great! I was anxious the first half, then I relaxed enough to go shopping at Value Village. I almost bolted out a few times because E was fussy and nursing on and off flashing my nip everywhere, but I didn't. I shopped. For *myself.* Then a random lady gave me a 20% off coupon!

geraltofbeeria,"I posted here months ago when my wife was in the midst of full blown PPD. It was bad, she was diagnosed with serious depression.

Now fast forward 11 months later, I think a lot of the issues have been resolved. Her depression turned to anxiety, but she seems to enjoy life a lot more now than she did a few months ago.

Yet tonight...we were happily watching ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"" with the kiddo. 

In one episode, the somewhat-neurotic character Abe starts going full-blown neurotic, envisioning slights that don't exist. I remarked, ""Oh god, I remember when the kiddo was three or four months, you were a bit like that...so glad that's over.""

I know, stupid. Stupid! 

  
She calmly turned around and remarked, ""You know, I still don't think I had PPD then. Have you considered that I was tired, and I was upset about how you never helped around the house? That I had to yell at you just to get you to do stuff?"" 

I was genuinely a bit stunned by her saying that. Because I -did- help, and as I saw her struggling with PPD, I ramped it up even more.

I didn't want to start an argument, so I said: ""I'm sorry if I didn't help enough in the past. But you know since those days I've been really trying to make sure that I'm pulling more than my weight so you're OK now.""

Her response: ""Yes, I know. But that doesn't address your previous behavior. Maybe one day I'll forget, but I won't forgive it. Ever. And just because you want forgiveness doesn't mean I'm obligated to give it. But anyway, the past is the past...and I want to keep on watching TV.""

And she continued watching TV like that previous conversation didn't just happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh. What do I do? Nothing? I don't think picking at this scab helps anyway, especially when she has her own recollection of what happened during those painful early months. But to some extent I realize that it's this deep-seated anger that puts some shadow in our married life.

Anyway, I thought it would be so great to be near family but I am honestly really struggling. I desperately need the break, yet I am also not wanting to share my baby so much. It is usually just me and him during the weekdays (I am finishing up my PhD and work from home while he naps). My mom and mother in law are both super hands on, and I know I should be grateful (and am), but I also feel sometimes like they are taking over. I feel terrible and selfish that I wish my baby would have a little separation anxiety, but he honestly is a really happy baby and seems to have no trouble when I am gone other than when he is hungry. I feel like a milk cow and am questioning how much my baby really feels a special bond with me beyond that. I can’t connect with him or feel close to him as easily as I do when it is just me and him. I just want him back to myself, but I know this is not healthy, as soon he will start growing up and he needs other people in his life too. Also my husband and I have been arguing a lot, and I get super jealous when my husband is playing with the baby...sometimes he walks in the room when I am holding the baby and gives the baby a big smile and talks to him and practically ignores me.

MechanicalEngineEar,"I am pretty sure my wife has PPD after our daughter was born and I assumed it was passing as she is 7 months now and things have gotten better, but I am realizing that some of what I thought was things getting better is me just accepting the new reality.  

My daughter is super easy to care for, even our nanny and friends say she is the easiest baby and we have no idea what a hard baby is like.  She basically doesn’t cry and is always in a good mood, but my wife has struggled terribly and in constantly either lashing out at me or just losing all confidence in herself.  

I was ready for the responsibility of a baby but I can’t deal with being treated the way she is treating me.  She is making my life miserable making up things to fight about constantly and choosing to not fight with her just means she screams at me for not caring.  There is no way to escape.  

I don’t know what is going on.  I have read PPD symptoms and it seemed like she hit every box for the first few months.  It is a little better now but I am thinking there is still something seriously wrong.  Luckily the worst my daughter has been involved was the car seat wouldn’t snap into the base once and she started shaking and jerking it with her in it and I stopped her but it wasn’t so much to hurt her.  

Some days she will literally start every sentence with me by saying “no” first.  She can’t even explain why she does it but she is clearly just dismissing anything I was saying so she can talk. 

Everything is an attack on her apparently and any attempt to help is me saying she is incompetent and any time I don’t offer to help I am being selfish.

fixingtotellyall,"I need advice on how to handle going home for the holidays. 
A little backstory: I (37/f) had our first baby in June, 4 weeks premature. My mother came out immediately to stay with us and help out, and stayed about 3 weeks. My husband and I live 15 hours away from our families and have no support system in place here. 
My MIL and BIL came out to visit and meet the baby when I was five weeks postpartum. My BIL stayed in a local hotel, but his mother stayed here with us in our 900 sq ft 2 br/1 ba home. They were here 4-5 days, but it was hugely stressful for me to have company, struggle with nursing my premie, etc. I know now that I was also dealing with PPD that was making me edgy and more anxious than usual. Although I was never outwardly rude, apparently I was not terribly hospitable and I made my husbands family feel unwelcome and awkward. 
(It might be worth noting here that she has known me for 15 years, but we have only lived away from them for 2 years, so this was her first time staying in our home).
My husband is a rockstar; he is amazing with our daughter and has been nothing but supportive as I have dealt with my PPD. But I am concerned that this has put him in a difficult place. 
We will be traveling to our families homes for an extended visit over the holidays. Do I owe my MIL an apology for my lack of hospitality? I feel that my mental health is private and not her business (I’m on medication now and doing much better) but at the same time, there’s no excuse for treating people poorly, and I don’t want there to be hurt feelings going forward.

Before we started trying for my first, I had been off wellbutrin for over a year and was in a really good place, but my husband and I were still cautious. Fortunately that pregnancy and postpartum period went really well, and I made it through without relapsing.

Now I have an almost 2 year old, and we are expecting #2 in December. This pregnancy has been so much harder than my first. Severe morning sickness lasted well into my second trimester, and I have been exhausted pretty much the entire time. I am constantly overwhelmed and feeling horrible feelings of fear and regret about this second child. Today both my toddler and me are sick with a cold. I lost my temper and screamed at her once and made her cry, and I feel absolutely awful. (I am normally working full time, so it's unusual for me to be at home all day with her).

I am having thoughts that get increasingly negative as time goes by, that I'm not meant to be a mother, that this new child deserves someone better than me. I recognize these for what they are but can't seem to stop them. Not only that, but I worry that things will only get worse when the baby has been born.

B1gPapas,"29 y/o father to a 10 week old. The first 5ish weeks were great, but about 5-6 weeks ago we had a few bad nights of sleep that sent me into a spiral. I sat in a work training just absolutely miserable, and started having intrusive thoughts about how pointless everything is and then started feeling scared of hurting myself. It progressively got worse in those 4-5 days after, which I knew it was time I got some help so I made an appointment with my primary. He ended up giving me Hydroxizine/Buspar, and referred me to the therapist. I went to see her and we talked it out which certainly helped. She ended up referring me to the psychiatrist and after our discussion he diagnosed me with an adjustment disorder, but  I turned down any further medication because I was feeling better at the time. 

For some context my wife is completely good, so proud of her, but also a little jealous that she's handling this way better than I am. Our baby boy is healthy and happy. I started a new job back in July so there's a bit of stress there, finances are good though. 

Fast forward to today and I'm about as anxious and depressed as I was in the beginning. It's like a complete regression and I'm scared. I don't want to hurt myself and keep telling myself I never would. I'm scared to take anti-depressants, but I want to feel better. I'm going to make another appointment with the therapist and hopefully see the psychiatrist so I can get something to nip this in the butt.

jamesdranko_,"TLDR: SAHM, 2 kids, oblivious working husband. Exhausted, moody, angry, overstimulated and annoyed at every little thing. Scared. 


So I have two little ones, a 2 1/2 year old and a 7 month old. With my first, pregnancy was great, no issues, he was pretty much the perfect baby. Slept thru the night at about 3 months.

Now with my second, breastfeeding was easier, he was just as happy, up until about 3 weeks ago. Getting him to stay asleep in the transition from your chest to crib is like carrying a bomb, he wakes up as soon as you start to lay him down. He also has been waking up every 45 mins at night, I’ve never been so exhausted and helpless in my life. 

I yell at my 2yo almost all day and feel horrible about it. I’m so overstimulated with noise and commotion all day, it literally makes my head rattle. I just want to sleep and I can’t, I’m uncomfortable because of the little bit of baby weight left, hormones are still making my hair fall out. As soon as one kid is down for a nap, the other wakes up or the dogs have to go out, or the laundry or dishes need done. I haven’t had any “me time” in over a year, and haven’t slept well in just as long. 

And getting my SO to understand this is impossible. He’s a great dad, just has zero concept of how badly I need help. I do 100% of the housework and cooking. When he has the kids and they annoy him, he just drops them off at his moms house for the day. 

Just in the last 4/5 years I have gotten out of a toxic situation with my mother and sister, and have learned a lot about myself, my emotional and physical health and have felt great up until this last pregnancy and birth. I feel like I don’t know this person that I am now. I’m lost on what to do. Some days are decent but most days I don’t want to play mom and just want to cry all day. 

I’m at a loss of what to do. Is this PPD? I feel like it’s not that extreme but I also feel like this is never going to get better. ",Postpartum_Depression,Completely Lost,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/9uyn5s/completely_lost/,1541615433.0,2018-11-07 11:30:33,

throwaway164578988,"This is going to be long, and I really don't know how to put it into a TL;DR. I'm sorry. 
Also using a throwaway account because I don't want to be ridiculed on my main for what I'm feeling. I've seen it happen to others, and I don't even want to try to be honest on my main. 


I'm 6 weeks postpartum. My baby is growing so well. Shes gaining beautifully and has the typical dirty diapers for the day. She sleeps so well at night because shes swaddled. 

That being said... I hate my life. I hate her. I hate how nothing is easy. 

Breastfeeding has been a real bitch. It's been issue after issue. When she was born, she wouldnt eat so the nurses hounded me like crazy. When she did eat, she tore up my nipples. She had a tongue tie. Got that corrected at 2 weeks, and then she was still having issues. Not staying latched. Constantly fussing because of that. Sucking down tons of air. MARATHON nursing sessions that leave my nippmes raw and flat as pancakes. Visited a lactation consultant and found a lip tie. Our ENT is booked until December. 

Now going on a week, she doesn't nap long during the day. 30 minutes mostly, and hour is I'm lucky. So I literally get nothing done. When I finally start to take a mental break for me, she wakes up. I don't get any break. Shes fussy with everyone else, most of the time, unless it's me. When she is on me, all she wants is the boob. 

It's so frustrating. This isn't at all how I pictured my life going. I had to drop out of college because I knew mentally it wouldnt be okay to finish for this first year of her life. My body is ruined. I'm not okay. And I don't even love my daughter. I hate everything. I look at her and get anxious. I hear any noise she makes and get anxious. I haven't talked to her. I haven't engaged. I feed her and then try to get her off of me asap. 

And my doctor told me that he doesn't believe I'm suffering from PPD since I can still enjoy other things. 

I don't know where this is going, but I figured this would be a safe place to vent. ",Postpartum_Depression,I don't know what's going on,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/9sez7g/i_dont_know_whats_going_on/,1540857913.0,2018-10-29 17:05:13,

I was told I could be on both Lexapro and Wellbutrin while pregnant, I stayed on only the Lexapro. I am having very bad post partum depression now and need to take Wellbutrin as well. My pediatrician is telling me taking both of these is not a good idea while breast feeding. I’m heart broken now, breast feeding is very imp to me and I’m beating myself up for not researching this earlier.  I am very sad about not being able to breast feed, having my breasts leak and having to wait for them to dry up is very tough.

PPDThrowaway_1992,"My Little One is 8.5 months and I think teething again. While in a happy relationship, I feel like I do 90% of the parenting. I can't get help from him because of his agricultural job requiring him to work  2am-7am and 2pm-7pm five days a week and just 2-7pm one day a week. My mother in law watches our daughter while we work and he picks her up since I work closing shifts at my job. She pretty much goes to bed right when they get home, so all he does is bathe her and put her to bed. I usually get home between 11:30pm-12am and have to pump again when I do. If I want a shower and dinner, I don't get to bed until 1am. My daughter usually wakes up at 1:30 or 2 so I don't even bother going to sleep until after she's woken up and gone back down, usually around 2:30 am. Up again at 5:30 and then awake for the day at 7am, right when hubby gets home. Last night broke me. I didn't have to close for once so I was able to go to bed at 10pm.

AStark89,"Sorry if this post is all over the place.

My daughter (M) was born May 6, 2018. She’s 3 months and 3 days today (not sure if the 3 days actually matter). Since I finding out I was pregnant in October 2017, my mother has literally been driving me insane.  She has been in and out of town constantly, because she doesn’t like the city we’re in, if I had to come up with a rough estimate of how long she’s been in town since October last year, I would guess approximately 4-6 months, and 6 is being pretty generous. She’s always been controlling, even as a kid. It was always “her way or the highway”. As a kid, ya, I can understand that. I’m a kid, not an adult. I’m not yet responsible enough to make tough decisions by myself. If I was a kid, I would need guidance. I am 29 years old at the end of the month. I am perfectly capable of making decisions and taking care of my child. 

My mother wanted to be in the delivery room and literally kick the obgyn out of the room to deliver my daughter. I told her no. When I went into labour, I told her I didn’t want her in the room, but she still threw a hissy fit when my nurse said she couldn’t be in the room (2 people were allowed in the room, not including hospital staff). My boyfriend (daughters father) and my doula were in the room, and that was what I wanted.

When my daughter was finally delivered (I had a very long labour and delivery), we knew how excited my mom was and because she was so upset, we called her first to let her know M had entered the world. She came to the hospital and after my boyfriend and I had both done skin to skin with her, we gave her to my mom to hold her.

Fast forward 2 days later, the doctors had kept me in the hospital, due to an infection, and I was finally discharged with my daughter. Later that evening, my mother had come by to visit and see M in her home. I was trying to breastfeed and where my daughter was literally eating every 2 hours, I was exhausted and my breasts were tender, my nipples were aching. My mom got angry with me because my one side was literally so sore, that the fabric from my bra made it hurt more. I’d decided to breastfeed on the other side to give that side a break. My mother forced me to feed on the sore side, aggressively squeezed my nipple and literally latched M so bad, that there was a bruise, right from the top of my nipple, all the way to the bottom. Then, after SHE got angry and wouldn’t let me do what I needed to do, continued to say, “oooh, it’s okay, you’re doing a great job! Don’t be so hard on yourself!” Obviously, she didn’t understand why I was crying. I refused her help after that.

She never respects mine or my boyfriends wishes. In fact, she ignores it, rolls her eyes and does it anyway. I want to slap her. I’ve told her about it time and time again. I’ve tried the nice approach, I’ve tried the angry approach. I’m almost at the physical approach now. That’s not good.

I’ve asked my mom to babysit 3 times in total. She wants me to ask her to babysit more, but I don’t think she would even be reliable. My boyfriend hasn’t been impressed either, where she’s making fun of the way we’ve decided to raise our child and goes behind our backs to do what she wants. I can’t trust he. I had an appointment the other day and had brought my daughter over to her house before my appointment and told my mom and her roommate, (who, by the way, wants M to call her gammy. Like, wtf, no!) that M had a really bad diaper rash, so make sure they put the diaper cream and corn starch on her bottom to help it heal. Her roommate goes on to tell me that babies don’t get diaper rash in disposable diapers, so she MUST be allergic to it (she’s starting showing symptoms of teething so I’ve been assuming it’s that) and continued to argue with me about it. I didn’t have time to argue and left for my appointment. After my appointment, my mother had M cuddling with her, and M’s pants and bib off. Fine. Her bum was changed and they’d fed her. Perfect. First thing my mothers roommate says, “we don’t like the bibs you use. You need to stop using them.” I said, “excuse me?” And she said, “well, they ride up and cover her mouth!” And I say, “oh, is that right??” Well, I guess if you’re going to babysit then you’re going to actually babysit, aren’t you? Or are you lazy and can’t pull it away from her mouth? She wears them for spit up and her drool.” Her roommate goes, “what??! She’s teething already?? She can’t be, she’s only 3 months!!” And I said, “well, I’ve looked it up and that’s what it says”. “Oh, okay. Let me show you something........ Look at these pictures of my grandkids, aren’t they great?!” I say, “yes, they’re very beautiful pictures.” Moms roommate, “Good, because yours suck so we were thinking maybe you should get them redone!” “EXCUSE ME??! You may not like our pictures, but we do. I don’t give a shit what you think of my pictures, but feel free to take yourself off of the mailing list.” I start getting my daughter dressed and talking to her while I’m putting her in her car seat, and she smiles at me. A big one, one of the ones that lights up her face. My mom says, “hey! How come she never smiled for me?!” And pretty much pushes me out of the way. I then say, “ well, I have to go. Talk to you later.” 

The following day, a close friend came to my house to babysit my daughter. We were planning on hanging out that day anyway so it worked out. My mom calls me twice during my appointment. I text her saying that I’m in an appointment and I’ll call her back after. She goes oh, me and your dad are leaving for the farm today and we wanted to drop some stuff off for you. Okay, I said, my friend is watching M, I’ll let her know you’re coming and you can drop it off. Fast forward 30 minutes later. I’m home. My mother had just gotten there 10 seconds before me. She’d turned onto my street just before I did. I park my vehicle. “Hey,” my mom says, “ how come you didn’t get me and my roommate to watch M. We were both really upset.” I said, “ya, well, I’m under enough pressure as it is without your roommate telling me off because she can’t keep her goddamn mouth shut.” My mother says, “ oh well, you can’t take what my roommate says seriously.” I say, “actually, I don’t have to listen to what she says because she’s not my family. I don’t want her babysitting my daughter if it’s going to be about how shitty of a mother I am.” 

I’m angry, all the time. I’m anxious. My doctor just put me on antidepressants and they haven’t taken affect yet. I can’t wake up when M cries and sometimes spending time with her is a chore. 

I don’t know what to do. My doctor said to avoid my mother and her roommate. I’m going to. Thankfully, my mother is out of town. I don’t know how to deal with her. She stresses me out when she texts me, because I’m trying not to lose my shit.

mamabear9143,"Nobody warned me that I wouldn't feel good enough for you. After years of crying for you, envying every one of my friends who sported a big belly, sorting through baby clothes and feeling the wiggle of life inside of them. Nobody warned me that there would be a day that I resented you and your fussiness, your cries of pain from a gas bubble that you couldn't get out. They always tell you that the epidural hurts, breathe through your contractions, that for 6 weeks you won't be able to feel that closeness with your partner again, maybe even longer. They say that your body will ache and you will be swollen, your belly will be deflated and your self confidence may take a nosedive when you finally find the nerve to look at yourself naked in the mirror for the first time. But nobody warned me that there would come a day that I hated myself for being so selfish and wanting you here. One day I would walk out of my door and cry while you cried in your swing, after I've tried everything I could to calm you and I would tell myself that I am too stupid for this. How am I going to raise a child when I have so much hate for myself. How can I cuddle you when every time we touch I cry because I know that if someone else were to do the things I do for you, you would be fine.

You are so tiny and so precious, I feel like I'm spending what could be our happiest moments wishing I could just disappear. Nobody warned me it would be this way. Nobody offered a shoulder or an ear if I needed it. I didn't know I would need it. I've been depressed before, but nobody warned me that I would cry every time I fed you, that I would get aggravated when I'm changing your diaper and you won't be still, that when I feed you and lay you back down and you scream bloody murder and there's nothing I can do but listen to you scream and cry until I can't breathe. You don't deserve this. You deserve a loving and patient mom, not someone like me. Nobody warned me that the intrusive thoughts would be too much. That I would think in detail how I would off myself every night while I'm laying in bed. Nobody warned me that suddenly I could relate to all of the new moms who fell victim to suicide.

I had my daughter two states away from my family and stayed there, alone with her, until she was two months old for maternity leave and health insurance reasons.

Thinking about the sleep deprivation alone at that period gives me anxiety just mentally going back there.

I attributed all of my symptoms to being a single parent and told myself I just needed to “try harder” get over it; PPD never even occurred to me. The anxiety, severe depression, suicidal ideation of me and her, extreme fatigue and exhaustion, isolation, etc., I could go on and on, never connected in my brain as possibly even being PPD.

I moved back home for “emergency support,” which I absolutely do have here from family, but I definitely don’t have “emotional support” or anyone looking out for my personally. I love my family, but they’re not warm and fuzzy people.

I haven’t been back to work full time since before she was born—-worked for about six months remotely after maternity leave, worked for less than a month after that full time before getting laid off, went on unemployment for six months, working remotely part time again now. I’m hoping getting back to work when she’s 18ish months old will curb a lot of the depression and will be better for both her and me.

notasiplanned2648557,"I gave birth to my second child a few weeks ago. I’m having a very rough recovery and I’m not taking it well. My baby is healthy and very easy. But me... I’m a wreck. My dr insists I’ll heal up and be okay but I’m having a difficult time seeing that happening. I developed a rectovaginal fistula and it’s breaking my soul. I’m scared that I’ll never be able to be intimate with my husband again. That it’ll be stuck in the bathroom just trying to feel clean. That I’ll never heal and be this way forever. The feelings of shame and embarrassment and not being a good enough woman, wife or mother are consuming me. 

I see an old photo in the house and desperately wish I could go back in time. To either not have kids or just have a whole different life. I have an amazing husband and two great kids... but all I want is a time machine. I want to be whole. I want my body to be okay. I think of all the things I used to worry about... my tummy not being flat again or my skin acting up... and I can’t believe something so minor ever bothered me. 

Last night my toddler crawled into be with me and fell asleep. I looked at him and my newer baby in the crib next to me... all I could think was how can I do this. How can I continue. I feel so broken and lost. I can’t live my life feeling this way but if I killed myself I’d leave behind my family and I couldn’t do that. I feel so stuck. This is time I should be cherishing my newborn and enjoying how tiny he is... but my birth injury consumes me and it’s staling the most precious time I have with my baby. And I feel like it’s just going to steal the rest of me too.

My sweet babe entered the world this past Sunday. He is absolutely perfect in every way. 

I had a really rough labor. But baby and I are both healthy and mom is well...moms gonna be recovering for awhile.

I’ve been worried about PPD most of my pregnancy, I always thought I’d be a prime candidate for it and-yes it’s still early so I am trying to take it Day by day. I know the hormones are flying everywhere right now so I’m trying to take that into consideration also.

Our first night in the hospital I missed my LO. (He was sleeping in his bassinet right next to me) but I snuggled his blanket and cried.

Our first day home was exciting and terrifying and I cried at least 10times. We just moved, our house is a disaster, but we have more than we need so I keep trying to count my blessings.

My husband is a saint. He is the most loving, supportive, caring man. &amp; he has done more for me than I can say -he actually suggested I find a group on here. 

The littlest things make me cry. I cried because now that he’s three days old he doesn’t look like he did when I first had him.

I cried because I wanted to be able to see my son when he sleeps and also see my husband at the same time.

I cried because I am so uncomfortable and wish I could just sit/stand/lay normally and be able to do more things with baby then just feed.

I cried because I can’t shower by myself and I walk like a sumo wrestler after each bathroom cost.

I would gladly do it all again to bring this perfect little angel baby here. But I wish people talked more about how HARD both physically and moreso mentally labor/birth/and motherhood is. I feel like I was in no way prepared for the emotional aspect that I’m currently living with. I have an amazing support system and I’m so so grateful that I do.

But I honestly just want to keep my little family just to myself. I don’t really want anyone to visit, I don’t want anyone else to hold him. &amp; I know everyone is excited too.

What do you feel are the biggest barriers to seeking care for mental illness treatment during the postpartum period??

fijuka,"Hi everyone, I'll try and write a really short version of what's going on: My boyfriend of 8 years has been having depressions for years, slowly fighting his way out of them. He has gotten a lot better, doesn't have trouble getting up in the morning anymore, going to work, he stopped smoking \(cigarettes and mariahuana\) and finally figured out what to do with his life, which is to study computer science and become a programmer. He also went to a therapist for 6 months but stopped, because he felt that it didn't help him anymore like in the beginning. I got pregnant \(unexpected\) and he said he didn't want a child now that he finally knew what to do with his life and when he wanted to start new studies. I, however, really wanted the child and assured him he could still do his studies as planned.. after a few days, we decided to have the baby, because he said he thinks it will be the solution that will make us both happier in the long run. During pregnancy, however, he had monthly breakdowns where he said he didn't really want any of this, that he was only doing it for me and that he regretted the decision. \(He also had these sort of breakdowns before, by the way.. just evenings where he suddenly started saying really heavy things like he doesn't really want to live etc.\). This was all really hard for me but I kept hoping that it would pass once the baby was here. Since the baby came \(he is now 8 months\), he has had these breakdowns once every 2\-3 months. In the beginning saying he hated his life now, that everything had changed, he missed alone time with me and he doesn't want all this responsibility and to make time for a baby in his busy schedule and that he regretted the decision. In\-between those breakdowns, he said that he didn't regret it at all, he is happy that we have our son, that he loves him a lot and is really sweet with him most of the time. A few weeks ago he even said that something had really changed now, that he was beginning to feel a bond to the baby and that it brings him joy to spend time with his son. Now on Sunday another breakdown. He didn't say he regretted having him but that he felt overpowered by everything, that it's too much and that he wants to spend his time doing other things than taking care of a baby \(it should be mentioned that I do pretty much everything, he sometimes spends 2 hours with him or watches him in the evening when he's sleeping anyway, the only thing he does almost every day is change him before bedtime and read a short book to him\). I don't know what to do anymore. When I ask him after these breakdowns he says it's a good sign how rarely these breakdowns happen now and that I should trust what I see most of the time: that he loves him and likes spending time with him. That he's not really himself when he gets in a mood like that.. I however am full of fear after these breakdowns, fear of the next one and mainly fear that my child will grow up hearing stuff like that, once he understands what his father is saying.. this thought is too much to bear for me, that my son will grow up having to listen to shit every few months, hearing that he wasn't wanted. On the other hand, it's good that he talks about it openly and it might be normal to have these feelings, especially if it's a form of PPD.. am I over\-dramatizing everything? Should I be happy that he's happy most of the time and believe that?

unknown_stuff,"I don't know how to help, and I need advice from those who have gone before me...

Background: I love my wife, and we have 2 wonderful children.  She is a stay-at-home mom to our 6 month old girl and 2.5 year old boy.  Both of them are absolutely wonderful, which she continues to express on a regular basis, and I agree with.  She is a stay-at-home mom by choice.  She has always wanted to be one, and leaped at the opportunity to leave work once my job was stable enough to provide for all of us.  Last night, my wife wrote me a note telling me that she wants to kill herself.  Everything she has described as being the problem is nearly word-for-word a description of postpartum depression, but this isn't the first time she has struggled with depression.

My wife has experienced depression in various forms since as long as I can remember.  For the most part, she continuously expresses that it's manageable.  If you were to ask her, she just has ""swings"" where sometimes she feels absolutely horrible and has nothing but terrible thoughts.  These swings stick around for a few days, and then ""go away."" She claims vehemently that her feelings never should have existed and she doesn't understand why she felt that way in the first place.  Every time this happens, she explains that it was silly for her to feel that way, and every time, the feelings come back.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it either.  We've tracked these ""swings"" together with her input, and they don't match to any cycle or pattern of events in our lives, they just... happen.  It has always bothered me, but to be honest, I have never known how to help much more than I already have.  I try to always be there for her and be supportive throughout these swings, but I don't know what else to do.  We have discussed professional help on several occasions, and I almost got her to agree to it during one of the more recent swings, but by the time we could call and schedule a meeting, she refused to do so because she was no longer feeling that way.  Cue the talk about how silly it was for her to ever feel that way and she is fine... it's quite obvious she isn't fine, but I don't know what I can do.

Right now I work 8-10 hours per day at work, and I am building a business by night.  When I am home, and the children are awake, I go into maximum dad mode.  I always wake up earlier than her on the weekends so I can get up with the children and let her sleep in, and I make sure I spend at least an hour a day with our children and put my son down to sleep each night so she doesn't have to worry about that.  This leaves us with about a half-hour to an hour per night that I can talk with my wife and eat dinner, but I feel like I'm tapped out time-wise.  Without her wanting to go to professional help, what can I even do?  Even if she does go to professional help, what are we going to do with the children?  With a 3 year old and a 6 month old, how can she go get help for an hour without us having to hire a babysitter and being dependent on their schedule?

I have tried different methods over the years as my wife has expressed issues with various things.  When the housework was overwhelming, I offered to hire a maid.  The maid came for 2 weeks and my wife dismissed her because she didn't want the added expense...  When child responsibilities were too much, we put our son in half-day daycare.  She barely made it on time to drop him off, and usually slept through the entire 4 hours he was gone.  Then, she would get angry that she had wasted her time while he was at daycare, and eventually pulled him out because she couldn't stand that we were ""spending money on something stupid when she should just suck it up"".  I mean, how do you help someone who thinks this way?

There appear to be a number of issues that come up, but every time she asks for help and I try to provide what she asks for, she ends up shutting it down out of guilt.  Now, with this note about her wanting to kill herself, I am very seriously concerned.  I can't keep doing this and pretending anymore.  She needs help that I cannot provide, and I am afraid that any suggestion in this direction is going to be entirely shut down on her end.  She has expressed that she feels like she isn't in control of her own life anymore, and that she cannot deal with the chaos any longer.  She just wants everything to end.  She has expressed feelings along these lines in the past, and I interpreted them as ""she needs a well-deserved break"", so I did things like planned an entire weekend away with the children so she could be by herself, or scheduled a night out for the two of us or just her where I watched the kids or we got a babysitter.  These things help, for a time, but she always goes back to feeling this way.  It is obvious now, with what is essentially her suicide note, that what I am doing just isn't enough.

QUESTION:  How would you deal with this?  How CAN I deal with this?  Is there anyone with advice for me? :(

Edit: Additional note - she is always ANGRY.  Even on days when she is feeling ""great"" she has this constant rage bubbling under the surface and it explodes out every time something sets her off.  This is a common symptom of PPD that people feel due to lack of control or understanding, but what does it mean when it's constant?  She had rage issues before our children were born and I don't know if that's necessarily something that comes along with non-postpartum depression.  I feel like I am in so far over my head... I genuinely care for her, and I don't like picking apart her mental state to try and ""fix it"", but I don't even see other options.",Postpartum_Depression,Please Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/88zr5p/please_help/,1522704920.0,2018-04-02 14:35:20,

But I don't care to be affectionate anymore other than hugs. Kissing, even lightly, seems foreign to me and just doesn't feel right. And being intimate is practically nonexistent and that's all my fault too. We've only had sex once within the past 7 months. I feel like the connection between me and my husband has been broken and I don't know what broke it or why and how to get it back. We weren't perfect before I gave birth but we were happy. We don't talk much anymore except through texts while we're at work, and our work schedules don't permit much time off together. But even when we're off we don't actually spend much time together. We're either just in the same room existing or I'm watching TV taking care of the baby and he's on his computer. It's hard to even find activities to do together with or without the baby because we don't have a ton of things we share in common to do. We run errands and that's about it. 

I don't know how to feel and I don't know what to do about it. Was it birth that changed my hormones and changed how I feel? What do I even feel? Is this something that can be fixed? Is this a problem from a chemical imbalance that will resolve itself? Is this PPD? I feel so depressed about it every day. Am I the only one who feels like this?",Postpartum_Depression,6 months PP.

-salisbury-,"Very new &amp; needing help! My first child is 5 months old and I have recently been diagnosed with postpartum depression. I’m shocked by this information but my husband (a doctor) seems to be under the impression that it was obvious. (He told me that he thought I knew.) We always agreed to two kids.  Since my daughters birth my husband has been more and more excited for number two. He loves parenthood and can’t wait to do it again. I have become more and more sure that I never ever want to do this again. Each day older seems like a step closer to my freedom. I’m painfully aware that another baby puts me back to square one. I love my daughter and she’s worth this to become a parent, but I am a parent now and I don’t feel any need to do it over. 

My question: for those who had ppd with previous pregnancies, did it make you not want to have more kids? Once the ppd was resolved did you change your mind? I don’t know if this is ppd or me realising that I don’t want any more kids... if it’s the latter I need to figure out how to proceed with my husband who feels the complete opposite. Prior to this diagnosis I was sure that I just didn’t want more kids. Now I’m not sure. Thank you!

GorkTheDestroyer,"A bit of backstory. 

I'm a 20 year old single mother who lives with her Dad, Step Mother and 9 out of my 11 siblings. 

The baby and I share a small room that holds barely enough to be considered ""our space"". 

When I found out I was pregnant I lived with my mom and was in the process of moving out with a friend. My Dad stepped in and was like ""hey come here, we won't charge rent etc etc."" so I moved here instead.  

I have a history of depression, self harm, and I have borderline personality disorder. 

I enrolled in a medical Assisting program to feel less like a worthless pos.  The post partum depression really started to kick in early January and at my sons 2 month check up I brought up that I was feeling depressed. 

My doctor puts me on Zoloft and after 4 weeks of it my life just feels like absolute shit. 

I lost my transportation because my engine seized, I have a negative bank balance because I decided to debt myself with school. I'm failing school because my son keeps me up all night and then during the day I'm so unmotivated and depressed I just lay in bed or sleep and don't do my schoolwork. And then at school I feel so overwhelmed I spend 2 hours or so out of the 4 hours I'm there crying in the bathroom because I feel like such a failure. 

I'm a heavy smoker and because I'm broke was forced to quit smoking and when I get angry I get violent and my self harm tendencies want to come out so I find myself punching walls and throwing stuff because what I usually use to calm down is cigarettes and I DO NOT want to break my 2 years of no self harming. 

I live in a shoebox of a room that is overflowing with baby stuff and my stuff and some days I want to just say f it to my things and throw them all away because I don't matter and it would just clear up room. 

My doctor just started me on Celexa today so I'm hoping in the next few weeks it will get better because the Zoloft just made everything worse. 

I just want to grab my baby and run away from all of my problems. Because this house and these people here make me feel like I'm drowning. 

I have no one to talk to.  My dad thinks mental illness isn't actually real and that you're weak if you have one. My step mom (despite her schooling (psychology) ) is the most insensitive person I've ever met and just tells you to suck it up. I hate my bio mom so she's out of the question.  And I'm on my dads insurance and the last time I was in therapy he got wasted and drunkenly called my therapist and harassed him. 

It just makes me angry that I was doing so well before I came here. My father is a toxic man and I thought because he works mainly out of town this house wouldn't be so bad. But then he comes home and I stay locked in my room with the baby because I'm scared to be in the same room as him out of fear that he will talk to me because he's always drinking and it always escalates into something. 

Some days I get so mad at myself for being in this situation and putting my son in a position where he could be influenced by my awful father. Sometimes I wish I would have never gotten pregnant because life would be so much easier and I could have done it right. School, marriage, then a baby.

ClarkandIndy,"I’ve reached out to my husband about how I’ve been feeling and he doesn’t seem to grasp the idea or look deeper into how I may be feeling. It’s daunting and dark and the thought of reaching out further is scary and exhausting.. I wish for a hand or a hug that pulls me up on my feet. Everyday is a new one and I try and tell myself this but on top of every positive thought sits gravity on top; as if I’m the horse stuck in the mud in the never ending story. The harder I throw my arms about, the deeper I sink and the darker my surroundings become. Incredibly emo (which makes me even more embarrassed by my emotions) but sadly accurate to how it feels when no one ‘believes’ you. I feel as though he would like to be supportive but is more wishing it would just go away and I’d be normal again. 

I can’t explain the guilt I have; I’ve read that this is a common feeling accompanied with ppd but I sometimes find myself apologetic to any person who spends more than 5 minutes in my space. Is this normal? 

I tried opening up to my mother gently on the subject (almost in passing) and she starts every sentence with ‘sweetheart’ and denies I’m in any pain and this is what everyone feels, making me feel more within myself and doubtful or almost embarrassed to admit anything. I’d like to bury the hatchet and try to get on with things and tell myself I’m being silly but every article I’ve read says this is unhealthy or not the right way to move forward. Not sure what other choice I have though considering the reaction I’ve been getting. I spoke to my doctor today following my 6 week post check and she recommended I go out more... is there supposed to be more support? Am I not saying the right things to get help? I feel dumb and a waste of time to the people closest in my life. 

I love my children so much and wish I was the fun mom again who loved to go out and play or do indoor projects like arts and crafts with them. I feel as if I’m letting them down with my lack of enthusiasm in life. 

Romantically, my husband and I haven’t been affectionate for some time.. including standard hugs or playfulness unless I prompt it. I feel like we’re roommates which, doesn’t help but these things cannot be forced and the very words bring tears to my eyes. I wish we could be more. He’s a wonderful man to our children and works so hard, I do love him very much. I  just feel so unhappy and feel as though I’m silently screaming out but not being heard, by anyone. My best friend tells me I’ll get through it and forgets the conversation the next day. She’s not a maternal person and isn’t the type who believes in marriage so this subject isn’t her forte anyway.

TheNerdyNursery,"I want to talk about something dark and scary that us moms don’t talk about enough: I want to talk about postpartum mental illness. 

Last month, I was committed to the psychiatric ward of my local hospital due to self harm and suicidal ideations related to severe postpartum depression and anxiety triggered by a traumatic pregnancy and having a preemie. 

I’d gotten into an argument with my sister in the morning (i don’t even remember over what) and then a full blown fight with my husband when he got home from work. We’d almost never screamed at each other before (best friend’s for 15 years), and he stormed out of the house with our 5 month old after elbowing me out of the way, leaving a bruise on my arm and chin. 

I felt worthless. As a best friend, as a wife, and as a mom. I sat staring at a full bottle of Xanax (prescribed to me for PPA and insomnia), thinking how easy it’d be for that dose to kill a 120lb female. I genuinely felt that my husband and son would be better off without me. 

Thankfully, instead of swallowing a bottle of Xanax and washing it down with whiskey, I called my dad and said i needed help. He took me to the behavioral crisis center at that hospital, and because i was admittedly suicidal, I was admitted. 

I ended up staying for 5 days and it was hell. However, it kept me from hurting myself and did give me some new coping skills. One of which was art. I’ve always enjoyed painting, sewing, and sculpting, but I’d never learned to use it as a therapeutic escape. It helped a lot more than the meds did (don’t worry- I’m still taking all of them as prescribed). 

As it happens, I’m at that age where it seems like all my friends are also having babies. So now I have an excuse to do a variety of art projects to keep me busy (I’m a stay at home mom) as well as create some more positive pregnancy-related feelings). 

Pregnancy and postpartum is not all about “the glow” and cute baby bump and planning names and nurseries- it’s HARD and between hormonal rollercoasters, a changing body, and a changing relationship with your spouse (not to mention working out the new financial strains, maternity leave, annoying relatives, and a million other things) it can really and truly suck. If you’re expecting or a new mom, pleas know you’re NOT alone in feeling depressed, enraged, apathetic, anxious...these are all signs of postpartum depression and/or anxiety. It’s TREATABLE, both with medication, therapy (one on one or group), and some behavioral and environmental modifications. Getting better is possible. 

The problem is, we’re made to feel like “this is the best time of your life!” and “you should be so happy” and “your baby is healthy; what more could you want?” and “you just need some sleep.” No one wants to talk about the darker sides of pregnancy and postpartum so we’re left feeling overwhelmed, alone, ungrateful, and confused. 

Please know you’re not alone. Please know you’re not a bitch or a bad mom for any negative feelings you’re having or thoughts that pop into your head. It’s a chemical imbalance playing cruel tricks on you, and it CAN be helped. All you have to do is ask. 

If you need a starting point, my inbox is always open. Postpartum.net is also a great resource to find PP therapists and groups. And of course, talk to your OB.

Kathy578,"So I have been discharged for 8 weeks from the hospital for PPD. I still feel like a mental mess, but I am progressing each week. I did quit my stressful job un-regretfully and DD is still in daycare.

My rejection of DD has nearly passed. I can care for her without getting angry with her. I don't blame her anymore for my condition. Some days she is too much so MIL happily takes her for the night.

MIL is still the same with her ""advice"" but I don't let it get me down or feel like a bad mother. I once told her that her ""advice"" was hogwash. She apparently asked her church friends and they agreed with me.

Shamefully, I didn't pick up my prescription and let it run out. After a week, I became tearful and perpetually sad. I have also been mad at DH. DH picked up my prescriptions on Friday and I am waiting for them to kick in again. TIL how important medication is for PPD!

With no job and DD at daycare, I have been ultra cleaning and purging our home. I feel a boost of pride to have such a clean home. I have also been trying my hand at hobbies like sewing, knitting, and basket weaving. Such activities has been helpful with my anxiety.

DH is really trying to step in. He has taken a more active role in caring for our daughter. I still blame him for his role in my PPD, but I am trying to forgive him. I am angry that he passes on our DD to his mom when I am unable to care for her, but I am realizing that he is just as overwhelmed as I was (doing it alone) and he is asking for help (like I was too guilty to do). He has been very supportive about quiting my job and leaving DD in daycare to help with my recovery. I am very grateful to him.

Jennyfire_,3 months into my pregnancy I started noticing drastic mood changes. I wasn’t as happy as I used to be. My mood would change really fast and my boyfriend didn’t know how to cope with it. He still doesn’t understand that I can’t control it. It just happens. I don’t even feel any connection to our daughter. She spent a few days in the NICU and I didn’t even want to visit her. I try to spend the least amount of time with her as I can and I feel so guilty. I know I shouldn’t be isolating myself from my daughter and boyfriend but I can’t deal with it. I tried therapy and it helped during the pregnancy but I haven’t had any motivation to keep going to it after giving birth. ,Postpartum_Depression,PPD and Rage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/7e32wv/ppd_and_rage/,1511147267.0,2017-11-19 20:07:47,

Kathy578,"I was on here nearly three weeks ago asking if I should admit myself to the hospital. Well, after I sent it, I realized that if I'm asking then I should go. Within the hour, my MIL had our DD and DH was with me in the ER. I was in the mental health ward for 11 nights.

I'm glad I did it. I was put on medication and forced to stop breast pumping. I realize now that I had become obsessive with breast pumping despite the affect to my health both in body and mind. 

I met other patients that talked with me to make me feel better and I felt gratified to do the same. I met one lady that was suicidal due to the death of her DH of many decades. She showed me the scar on her wrist from her attempt when she was a young mother suffering PPD. I met bipolar, schizophrenic, suicidal, addicts, split personalities, and healthy people that just said the wrong thing that got them admitted. I am very grateful to many of them for being kind to me. I learned very quickly they were not judgmental and took care of each other.

I was homesick and ecstatic to be going home to my family when I was discharged. Very quickly, I realized that I was angry with my baby and got anxious too easily. I had never blamed my baby or had no wish to care for her until after my stay in the hospital. Before, I always took it upon myself to lovingly care for her because I should as her mother. In my guilt, I smashed a teacup on the wall. It was the first time I was violent and normally I can talk myself out of destroying stuff. Needless to say, DH packed up all the china.

I'm still not myself and still trying to recover. I have some bad moments, but each days seems better. I am on indefinite medical leave as of now. DD still goes to daycare and my MIL for the night.

witnge,"I got diagnosed with antenatal depression while pregnant. Was still depressed after my daughter was born so it got called postnatal depression. She's 18 months old. I was doing better for a while bit still medicated and doing therapy. For whatever reason I'm in another down patch. Probably the worst since she was born.

I never had depression or thoughts of self harm or suicide before I was pregnant. They told me it was probably my hormones being out if balance and the pending life change if becoming a mum.  Well isn't 18 months long enough for things to have balanced out? Is this still postnatal depression or is this now depression unrelated to being pregnant? I don't want to be on antidepressants indefinitely, I had thr side effects but anytime I attempt to lower my dosage things get really really bad.

SalvyComplete21,"Recently I've given birth and she is almost 2 months now. Since giving birth, my whole life has changed. I think what I find most upsetting is my husbands life really hasn't changed. I've gained the baby weight (10lbs), I get up in that middle of the night to take care of her, I do most feedings and diaper changes. He really hasn't made any life changes or sacrifices. He hasn't needed to change or watch his diet, didn't need to go to multiple doctor appointments, or stay at home for 3 months while he sees her for 4-6 hours on weekdays. 
I can't help but envy my husband and his life. He never had to carry a baby therefore didn't need to change anything about his lifestyle (alcoholic drinks and certain foods), his hormones are not out of control, he gets to go back to work without worry about baby and able to socialize, his family lives in town, and his friends are excited and eager to see her. I on the other hand are at home all the time with our baby while she continues to yell and cry and sleep. I feel trapped but have to take care of her. I am an introvert but I usually socialize at work. But without work I have no social life. My social life has been reduced to ""how was your day?"" and ""what would you like me to make for dinner?"" I am not against any stay-at-home moms, and pretty to them, but honestly mom life is just not for me. I work in a trauma medical field, I need that thinking skills on the spot. I feel like I'm treating her as one of my patients versus as my child. That makes me feel terrible because I am lacking that feeling of wanting or needing to love her or even give her the love that she deserves. I keep reading on how or what to do for Mom's her age, realizing I honestly feel it doing that.
To top it off I honestly feel like I'm raising her alone. My husband comes home and maybe sees her for 5 hours a day. I have to tell him to hang out with her or to do things with her. Even on the weekend I feel like I'm still the main parent who takes care of her. I haven't gone back to work yet but I honestly feel like he will not realize how hard it is to be a solo parent most of the time until I do go back to work. I have also realized our lack of intimacy and sexuality. I do not know the reason as to why there's a lack of intimacy. Maybe he is just not interested or terrified that he might hurt me.
My family lives out of state and his family lives about 30 minutes away. His siblings are either extremely busy or super selfish with they're own lives. I can't blame them, we were selfish as well before a baby. His father pretends to vomit at the sound of a fart or fowl smell therefore can't/won't watch her and his mother still works full time. I basically have just him and her in my life right now. Some days it's a miracle if I can even get a shower in. I had many co-workers that were looking forward to me having a child and them coming to visit to realize that no one that I work with has yet to do so. They have all made plans but something is always came up to cancel it. Honestly makes me wonder I'm actually liked at work or if it's just summer time and it's a busy time for everybody.
I have an appointment with my doctor soon to talk about these issues. It is to see that if they are actually issues or if I'm having postmenopausal issues. There are times when I reflect on my thoughts thinking that they are legitimate things that I should bring up but other times I think I'm just being a selfish new mother. But most the time I just don't know what to think. I just knew that she deserves to have a happy and good and healthy mom and I hope if I'm not that that I can be that soon or one day.
So I'm mainly just looking for conversation or just understanding. Maybe I need a stranger to tell me that I'm being super selfish or for them to tell me that I'm having some postpartum issues. All I can tell you is that I really enjoyed my life before I was pregnant.

notsotoothless,"TW: Discussion of rape

I was in a 2 year relationship with a man I almost married who, among a plethora of other abuses, raped me repeatedly. Thank Christ I never got pregnant when we were together, but since then I have been paranoid about becoming pregnant when I wasn't ready and take a test about once a month for reassurance. 

With my DH, I was finally ready to have a child but was still fearful of what pregnancy and childbirth would do to me given past experiences. I was fortunate to be what my nurses called ""medically boring"" and except for some concerns about dehydration had a very smooth pregnancy and delivery. Didn't stop me getting PPD.

After I finally accepting what my ex really did to me, I got angry. So incredibly angry. Then along came PPD, and I got even more angry. I was so overcome by rage a couple of weeks ago that I was throwing things, broke a couple of (incidental) items in the kitchen and literally could not speak. Once, during pregnancy, I got so outraged about something my cat broke that I screamed for a full 30 minutes until I lost my voice.

I have always been prone to depression and specifically depression that manifests as anger. I remember as a child that I hated my brothers. I mean, I fucking **despised** them. Until finally something broke in me and I didn't have the strength to carry that kind of rage anymore so I just shut down for several years before I started self-harming and then finally circled around to a somewhat healthy mental state. (During my self-harm phase, I actually did reach out to a therapist who told me he thought I was ""just a very serious person"" and there was nothing wrong with me. Since then, I've been soured on the idea of therapy considering the amount of time and effort it would probably take to find a decent therapist and the fact that it would all be out of pocket cost.) I feel like the abuse I went through combined with my PPD are going to set off the cycle all over again. I don't want that. I don't want to put myself or my DH through it, and I don't want my daughter to remember her childhood that way. 

We have less that $50 in our account after bills. Even if I were willing to pursue therapy, I can't afford it. I don't want to go down this path again, but I don't know how to stop it.

I have a hard time convincing myself to shower or eat. I feel like my identity has been ripped away from me and I have no sense of self anymore; often I just feel like an ambulatory womb.

Last night I cried for hours just wishing I would have got an abortion. Wishing my birth control didnt fail me, wishing I didn't have HG, wishing I could just be me again - working and doing my makeup and everything else I used to. 

My partner convinced me to talk to him and he thinks I'm going through postpartum depression, but I dont see how as I haven't actually given birth yet.

I dont want to feel this way. I love her and at the same time I dont. I feel like I've failed her and failed myself. I'm worried that when she comes I will be a terrible mother, but at the same time I am horrified at the idea of being a mother at all. It's such a strange mix of emotions.

Is it possible to be going through PPD already? Should I tell my OB/GYN about this or see a therapist?

clb0128,"Today I'm three weeks postpartum. Last night I broke down and confided in my husband about my depression. The problem is I've been depressed for over a year and a half. I struggle to show him that I'm happy in our marriage, that I love him, that I appreciate him.

I dated a guy who struggled with severe depression. I have walked in on him holding a gun to his head or lying in a puddle of his own blood because he had cut himself. And I never understood when I was with him how someone could want so badly to die. But now I get it. I'm honestly tired of living the way that I am. Knowing that I'm only living because I don't want to hurt my husband (and now my beautiful daughter). The thing is I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to think that dying would make things better. I don't want to be depressed. I'm tired of living for other people and not for myself. 

I love my daughter, she's the most precious thing I have ever seen. She's the best thing I've ever done. But it's hard to be happy right now. It's hard to be okay when at 130 in the morning I'm sitting alone in my living room on the couch pumping and massaging my sore and engorged breasts. Massaging- hah that makes it almost sound pleasant. Let's be clear about one thing: it's not pleasant. It is painful. 

I've cried more times than I'd like to count tonight. I've cried because of physical pain, I've cried because my baby was crying and wouldn't stop, I've cried because the intrusive thoughts about harming myself scare me, I've cried because my husband and I are fighting, I've cried because when we had company earlier I could barely put on the ""I'm okay"" mask, I've cried because I'm hormonal, I've cried for no apparent reason. But mostly it's been because I'm not okay. And even though I know postpartum depression is a very real thing, I feel like everyone still expects me to be okay. Last night we had company. They very generously brought us dinner, they wanted to check in on us and baby. They both asked me at least twice how things were going. Through gritted teeth I simply said ""they're going"" even though I wanted to say that things sucked, that I'm not okay, that I'm crying constantly and I feel like crap physically, that I'm exhausted, that I'm stressed, that I'm overwhelmed. But instead I said that I was fine and turned my face away so they couldn't see the tears beginning to well up in my eyes because I'm not okay and why should I be? My whole world is upside down. Not necessarily in a bad way, but it's not normal. I'm dealing with a million things I've never dealt with before. I'm stressed to the max and I'm overwhelmed. I worry that I'm doing everything wrong. ",Postpartum_Depression,My Struggle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/6ha1u0/my_struggle/,1497495815.0,2017-06-14 20:03:35,
Mayy95,"My birth control failed me two months before I got married. I did not get to enjoy my marriage, my partner, and life. Just when I was enjoying my life, and terminating our wedding plans, I went to the clinic and they gave me the ""you're pregnant"" news and my whole world went down. I felt so confused. I was almost done with my career, almost married, but then that happened. Why did I go on with it? Because of my overly religious family. 
And now I'm stuck in a life I did not want and although I love her very much, I am not happy with my life. Every day is a living hell. I struggle to go back to my old life. I used to exercise everyday, go out to the mall, enjoy being alone and now I spend my time behind four walls glued to a 3 month old. I've never felt so lonely in my life, so empty, no useless to society. I used to enjoy working all the time and now I can't. My mom tries to take care of her so I can work but she's almost always at church with her church group. I can't believe I went through school and half way through college just to become a stay at home miserable mom. Please don't judge me, I don't know why I still feel like this.
It's been three months and I am struggling to get through everyday. I am stuck in a life I don't want to live...everyone says  ""it gets better"" but I don see that. I don't see anything improving.

Shyabusedmomma,"okay im 21 and a mother to my beloved 18 month old baby. When my daughter was first born everything was okay, well it wasn't perfect. My baby only had a bassinet and wouldn't sleep in it, and I punch and kick in my sleep. i was afraid of co-sleeping in a bed and ended up sleeping with my baby in the living room in a chair. I also lived with my family that are noisy and no sympathy. and i got so tired and i couldn't sleep cause i was expected to clean the whole house so when the baby would sleep i would try to move her and clean if she didn't wake up. and im so ashamed but sometimes i would put my daughter in her bassinet and she would cry and id scream into a pillow or just cry with her. i usually would end up walk into another room and taking another breath. about 3 months later i started to get suicidal thoughts again and i had panic attacks. and I sat down with my parents and begged then for help and they said i was faking it and was just wanting attention and that pills wont help me. ( i have since taken me and my daughter out of that home for several reasons) but i have problems still (cant afford a therapist). i get mad at my daughter and yell at her (like ""go to sleep,and no!) and i smack her hand when she gets into things that shes not supposed to. what scares me is sometimes i go blank when she cries at night (cause she doesn't want to sleep) and a couple of times i have covered her mouth when she screams and i feel like crap about it. like when she smiles, or gives me a kiss, or says mama, or even is minding her own business i feel like im a terrible mother and that i dont deserve her. i've considered suicide several times and the only reason i dont do it is cause im a single mom and my daughter's biological father is a danger to her, and i dont want my abusive family to raise her.... i dont know if i have postpartum that has been dragged out or its just depression... i hate how i get mad and it makes me more mad and i just end up frustrated and stressed out. help please...",Postpartum_Depression,Single mom with issues,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/68y8cn/single_mom_with_issues/,1493811007.0,2017-05-03 04:30:07,
casidaisy,"27 yo female with an 11 month old daughter and a 5 yo step-daughter. 

I've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. After my daughter was born it got worse. I would cry all the time, freak out, go into panic cleaning mode...her cries were like razor blades in my ears. I never got the motherly instinct to comfort her, I just wanted to scream and yell at her to stop. I still feel like that 11 months later; I have no patience and my fuse is so short it's almost nonexistent. 

I should also add that aside from my partner's mom and dad, I have no one here for me. His ex wife has told me I can talk to her, but I know that makes him uncomfortable. His best friend's wife, and another of his best friends has told me I can talk to her, too, by I have social anxiety that has developed over the years and I always end up being super awkward and saying weird, vague shit. His parents are great, but they travel a lot to visit his siblings in other parts of the country so I don't have a reliable person to call on when I need help.

I talked to my doctor a couple months in and was prescribed Sertraline, a generic Zoloft. I don't feel that it's helping at all. I don't get to go to any counseling or talk therapy because we work opposite schedules and I never have time during normal business hours. I just feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place and I don't know how to get out of it. I rarely sleep, I almost never eat, and when I do it's absolute shit. 

Something else I deal with is my SO's inability to understand what I'm going through. When I am struggling or when I tell him what's wrong, I'm met with crappy reactions or him talking to me like I'm a child. I know he wants to help me, but in the moment his reactions make me feel worse. Example: today baby hasn't slept all day. She didn't sleep all night, either. I work until 2:30 am, so I've been awake for a loooooooong time. Baby screamed her head off for the better part of two hours and all I kept wanting to do was tape her mouth shut and put her outside. I would never hurt my baby, but the thoughts in my head scare the shit out of me. His response: ""you can't say that stuff while I'm at work helpless, wondering what may or may not happen to my infant daughter.""

He speaks like I'm a babysitter and I abuse babies. This is someone with whom I share my life, someone who knows me...and yet I get backhanded comments about me harming our child. I understand that can happen with PPD, but that response really messed with me. 

I just don't know what to do. I know a lot of people struggle with PPD and PPA, but I still feel so alone. ",Postpartum_Depression,My Constant Struggle with PPD/PPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/68vzm1/my_constant_struggle_with_ppdppa/,1493784945.0,2017-05-02 21:15:45,

Sassybru10,"I have dealt with depression and anxiety my entire adult life. I got off my meds when we were thinking of having children. 
Had my first child with no real issues, the birth the was text book, a little baby blues but then I was fine. The second one came along a little more than 1 year later and that birth was anything but normal. Technically everything went ok but it was traumatic for me and I'm not quite sure I ever got over it. It's been a little over a year now and I'm in full blown depression and anxiety hell. I was crying daily and losing it at every little thing. I finally went to the Dr a few weeks ago and got back on my meds after being off them for 5 years. 
My husband although mostly supportive has really taken a turn in the past few months. He knows what I'm dealing with but at the same time he's fed up. I went too long thinking I could get better on my own but now that I'm actually being proactive, trying to have a better attitude...he's not. His attitude has a huge effect on me and one wrong side-eye or comment throws me back down and I feel like I'm starting all over, pretty much daily. How do I overcome his attitude to better my own so in return his will get better? 
Due to my work schedule I don't have time to see a therapist. I just started a new job, I have 2 little ones, and a husband so time isn't my friend.

rainbowbabyresearch,"Greetings Mamas!

Are you a mother who has ventured down the road of carrying a new pregnancy after experiencing a pregnancy loss or losing your newborn/infant?  Have you since given birth to your rainbow baby (who is currently 5 years of age or younger)?  If you answered yes to these questions, then I would love to hear about your experiences of your rainbow pregnancy and motherhood.

My name is Kelsey Nibbelink and I am a Master’s degree candidate in the Infant Mental Health program at Mills College in Oakland, California.  I am conducting a study which examines mothers’ feelings about their experiences of reproductive loss (elective abortion, therapeutic abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death), their subsequent “rainbow” pregnancy, and their current relationship with their rainbow child.  This research is supervised by Dr. Carol George, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology at Mills College and has received IRB approval from Mills College (Nov. 2016).

Your participation in this study is voluntary, anonymous, and completely confidential.  Participation entails completing a web-based survey, which will take approximately 25-35 minutes to complete.  All participants who complete the questionnaire can choose to enter into a drawing for a $25 Amazon or Target gift e-card.

She is a stay-at-home mom. I am the bread winner and I own part of a family business. I do maintain a good work life balance.

I started to see issues arise right after the baby was born. It was as if I was not adequate in her eyes, I couldn't do anything right. 

Since I do work in a family business and I manage a few people, my leave was sometime interrupted for a few minutes with questions or quick troubleshooting of issues remotely. She immediately took issue with this and started a campaign against my family.

There is a lot of blaming going on directed solely at me. I'm passive in the sense that I really don't dish anything back. I know there is a problem and I don't want to make it worse.

I am at the point that we have been to marriage counseling, and all the counselor covered in a few sessions was better communications and didn't want to touch any PPD issues.

Sillybutter,"I first realized I was depressed when I was pregnant. During a very planned and happy pregnancy I was miserable and could not understand what value I would have as a human and how dare I decide to become a mother. I dismissed my friends and doctors who pointed out my depression. I made excuses for the way I was feeling and played at off as just being upset over the changes I had to face. Yet I would stand in the shower and say terrible things to myself and I was convinced I was useless and awful. 
After a two day labor and traumatic emergency c-section I went on to have full depression. I couldn't cook. Clean. Dress myself or smile. I was dead inside. I would do exaggerated fake smiles Timmy child. I could not speak to him or sing or do anything that was considered motherly. I did breastfeed but in all honesty I did it because it was the only thing that I could do. The only thing that I somehow hadn't been able to prove to myself that I was a failure at. I nursed for two years and that was it. My saving grace. 
I come from a very toxic family who spews such hateful mantras it would make you vomit. It was refreshing that at least when they would pick on my while I nursed, saying that I didn't have enough milk, that I could pull my breast from my nursling and squirt a dozen streams of milk several feet in their direction. Each time they would chuckle and move on to the next thing. But at least I could nurse. 
Writing this has me in tears although it's been a couple years. 
I held on to the one thing I knew I could do and over time added one or two things back to my list. I was not a failure. I was not a nobody. I was not hated. I was not scum. 
I had planned my life very carefully, married a sweetheart, we made very good money, lived in a very nice place, I was done with school and had my dream job. We planned this child and the moment that test said positive my world in my mind had entered a twilight zone. I was this person who was trapped in a fog of self hate and could not find a way out. 
No one could help me. But the people closest to me, mother, grandmother, husband even, friends, actually made it worse by constantly pointing out my flaws and digging at my insecurities. Some meant no harm but all in all I can see how bullies can affect an already depressed person. 
It's been almost a full year that I have felt like my old self. But even so, I seem to wonder if I have always been somewhat depressed. If I have ever been happy. Have I always had depression and then it was exacerbated by my pregnancy? 

I need to know. Because I can't go through it again. I can't become pregnant again if there's a risk I could disappear. And for how long next time? My mind was so terribly cruel to me.

ElsieG,"I have been struggling with postnatal depression for five months now, I am not even sure if you could call it 'postnatal' anymore. I have struggled with depression in the past, but it doesn't compare to what I feel now.

aconsidine89,"I am a member of the NICU club (as my son's nurses told me to help me cope). After a high risk pregnancy due to polyhydramnios and 2 days of being induced, my son arrived seemingly healthy. 8 hours later, after the joyful tears and visitors, I woke suddenly to my husband holding our son and screaming, ""Breathe! Please breathe!"" My son was choking on excess amniotic fluid and I slept through it. He was turning blue and I SLEPT THROUGHT IT. Had my husband not been there, had he stepped out for a cup of coffee or a phone call, my son would be gone and it would have been my fault. I think this is where the dark battle downhill began. I went home without my baby. My worst possible nightmare came true. I cannot describe the feeling I had walking out of the hospital that day, leaving my newborn with strangers, hooked up to machines and IVs. That's when it got worse. We slept in the NICU every night, only going home to shower and eat. A week later, we brought him home and I thought the feeling would go away, but it didn't. 

I felt overwhelming guilt for everything imaginable. Still guilty that I slept through my son choking for air, guilty that we were due to move across country soon (husband is military) and away from my amazing parents, guilty that I have to be a working mom and knew I couldn't stay home forever, guilty that I didn't hold my son enough, guilty that I didn't exactly love breastfeeding, guilty for everything. Then the anxiety crept in. I didn't leave the house alone because in my mind, everyone wanted to steal my child or run me over with their car in the parking lot of Target, or that he would catch some awful illness. I stared at him as he slept and stayed awake for days on end because I was petrified he would stop breathing. Then the OCD began. I needed a bulb suction in every corner of the house - just in case he choked again, cleaning bottles and practically burning my skin off because the water had to be scalding or they weren't clean, meticulously counting diaper changes and minutes I nursed. It didn't help that every doctor appointment, including my son's pediatrician, gave me the post partum depression survey - which I constantly failed. 

Finally my son's pediatrician basically said, ""Your son deserves a happy mom - you need to get help."" They put me on a low dose of Zoloft, but after weeks of taking it, I still felt worse. I tried a PPD meeting, only to feel worse when another woman spent 35 minutes sharing how ""meds are terrible when nursing so I refused and instead I do cross fit because getting my body back cured my PPD""....as I sat across from her feeling fat, makeup running from the tears of a panic attack in the car, and thinking about how awful I felt taking Zoloft while nursing. 

It's been 6 months since my son was born. I stopped taking the Zoloft after 5 months. I think my family thinks I'm fine. My friends never knew that I didn't invite them over while I was on maternity leave because of the crippling PPD. I don't really talk to anyone about it because I feel hopeless. I battled anxiety and depression since age 11 and therapists never helped. Medication helped a lot before, but this is different. I don't ever think of hurting my son, and I don't really think of hurting myself, but I just feel like I'm worthless and my son deserves more, like I'll never be the mom I so desperately want to be. My husband and I argue more now than ever, I feel myself pull away from him as he pushes me away. Every single day I feel like I'm holding my breath just hoping he lives another day, that I don't royally fuck up and let him die. One day, one minute, one second at a time gasping for air and praying I don't find him dead in his crib or he gets kidnapped..horrifyingly dark thoughts. I love my son, and he is so amazing.

My wife and I just had twin boys, and two months in I am more miserable and angry and frustrated than I've ever been in my life, and I've never been a really happy person. I go to sleep at 8pm, get up at 2am, and it feels like a nightmare from the minute I get out of bed until the minute I fall asleep, if I sleep at all. Just hearing a sound out of either kid sets my teeth on edge, I find myself consumed with such an unreasonable hatred that it scares me. I completely understand that they're babies, have no control over their world, no way to communicate other than crying. Logically, everything they do makes perfect sense, the reflux, the gagging, the gas, the crying, the sleep issues. But I cant change the waves of rage and frustration that I feel like are constantly eroding my sanity. My wife is blissfully happy, so I'm trying to let her get out, let her hold on to that happiness, so at least one of us is sane. When I leave the house, I'm just consumed with regret and thoughts of how life was before these two showed up. Of all the things I've willingly given up, nothing is pleasurable anymore. I've worked on the water for years, always loved the beach and the ocean, and now it just pisses me off to be there and know that I had it, right there, and I gave it up for the nightmare my life feels like now.

MommaLeo,"Hello, I'm new to this subreddit and PPD. Since my son was born, 3 weeks ago, I've been really down. I can't stop crying and feeling overwhelmed. Then...when I feel overwhelmed, I get mad and upset with myself because I feel like a terrible mother for feeling that way. When he cries, I feel like I'm having a panic attack and can't handle it.

I have the absolute best husband and support from him. He helps me at night, takes him when I feel overwhelmed, and generally just wants me happy again. The sad part is that I've been such a jerk to him, unintentionally, because I've been so upset. 

Now I know that I haven't gotten much sleep. With my son being only 3 weeks old, sleep is rare. I went to see a doctor today about it and she told me that they classify anything up until 6 weeks ""Baby Blues"". Now my question is...would I feel that way with baby blues? Or is it something more? She had me take a questionnaire that has to do with PPD, and said I scored well above a 10. I'm just so confused and I don't know what to do. 

She suggested a counselor, which I'm going to try to find one that works with my insurance tomorrow. She also recommended medication if I was interested. However, since I'm breastfeeding, I was afraid to take that step yet. Should I still consider medication if it's just baby blues? I'm completely new to this and I just need a little guidance and reassurance.

I know I have to do something. I've cut sugar out of my diet, I'm drinking more water, I'm at the gym twice a week, I have a helpful husband and mother at home.... Tons of support. And I'm proud that I can be a full time working mom and manage. 

But I'm not managing. Babe is 4 months, his sister is 3. Lack of sleep and anxiety about everything is making me tearful and moody and panic attackey. I feel like a crazy person cuz so many ppl have it harder.

TokiTover,"I had this happen to me 8 months ago when I had my baby girl. It was an odd and scary thing to experience. 

For me, I never said a word. Not to my mom or my partner. The only way I got help was from a questionnaire I filled out at the doctors office because I got severely ill.

I told the piece of paper how I was feeling. How sad is that?

From there, I got rooted over to my OB for the psych evaluation. It was not bad but I was done. The only thing that was prescribed to me was sleep.

What?! Yes, sleep. I was extremely sleep deprived. 

But what mom isn't? 

I was to sleep for 4 days straight. No baby, no pumping... nothing. My mom and friend had to take shifts to feed my little one. I was to report to my OB how I was feeling daily. Also I was on the brink of crazy dehydration. Drink water mommies!

After all was said and done, that ""feeling"" went away. I found support reading other womens stories and just talking about it. When reading other stories, it helps to facilitate your healing and your family.

I was also able to be honored to write monthly for Postpartum Support International blog. I have sent over 2 already. When they are posted, I'll will post here for you to view.

This is no joke. It was like a light switch that turned on and I wanted nothing to do with motherhood. Guilt was huge too.

The best way to describe my bond with her is that I feel like i'm babysitting someone else's kids but I know they're never coming back for her.

She gets up about ever 2-4 hours at night so i'm exhausted during the day. 
   At night when she won't stop crying i get terrible thoughts. like i want to get in the car and drive away without her. I want to shake her but it goes beyond that thought I think about what her body would look like while i shook or what her neck would look like before it snapped. i feel horrible admitting it but now I think about it in the day time when I get to my wits end.
   My doctor upped my prescription of anti depressant a couple days ago and said this is normal of new moms to get thoughts like this and I was right to put her down and walk away for a few minutes.
   I don't hate her but i don't feel like a mom or she came from me. I constantly have to double check my scar to make it seem real. I do like her more compared to other peoples babies (i LOVE babies) 
   I feel awful for having these thoughts and i never act upon them but is this normal do other people have thoughts like this.

handee_sandees,"Hi guys, I'm honestly kind of at a loss here. Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.

But for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.

I also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a ""I'll get to it later"" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.

I also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.

We also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?

Thank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

massenburger,"So my wife just had our 3rd baby (baby girl, very healthy!), and is having something that seems a little disconcerting to me. She really wanted to give birth all natural, with no epidural. She made it into the 3rd stage of labor (I think that's what it's called, where the contractions are over a minute long, right before pushing?), before she couldn't take it any more and asked for an epidural.

After the birth, she's told me that whenever she recalls the birth, she's remembering it like a nightmare, like the pain of the birth is literally scaring her. She's told me she definitely doesn't want any more kids almost solely because of the memory of the pain. This didn't happen with either of our first two. What's concerning to me is just how intense this is for her, it's almost like a mini PTSD episode from what I can tell (and I know nothing about PTSD, so I could be way wrong about that); her eyes get bigger, and her mood immediately changes whenever she talks about it.

I don't even know what brings up these thoughts, and it scares me that i can't seem to shut them off. I don't have any other symptoms that I can think of. 

I plan on talking to my OB-GYN this week- but I thought I'd post to see if I could get an idea as to what to expect. I have never been diagnosed with depression before, so I'm unfamiliar with the process. Do I just tell him what I've posted here? Will he prescribe something right away? I'm still breastfeeding and would like to continue- is that possible? 

Thanks in advance for your help. ",Postpartum_Depression,Unsure how to move forward,http://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/30rooj/unsure_how_to_move_forward/,1427710516.0,2015-03-30 03:15:16,
graymal-kin,"Hi guys. If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.


At 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a ""zombie,"" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.

Then I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.

I love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.

Sorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).

I'm eager to hear how any of you cope with your PPD day to day? I want to feel whole again. Not ""happy.""

Ur_a_wizard_Barry,"Wondering about people’s experiences with treating their PPA/PPD with medication. I have been on wellbutrin for years and my PPA has gotten out of hand, so I’m speaking to my doc about it tomorrow. I have some concerns though, so would love to hear about anyone’s experiences with treatment. 

A little background- PPA was severe right off the bat so my doc upped my Wellbutrin dosage. I’ve never had suicidal thoughts or anything while on it, but in the last few months I’m having trouble with some insomnia and thoughts about dying constantly (car crash, random stuff like that.) My daughter is 10 months and I really thought I was over the PPA hump. But I’ve been dealing with these random bouts of rage on top of the insomnia. Like the smallest thing triggers me and of course the only person I have to take it out on is my sweet husband. So I know he’s miserable too. 
I think I need to be on a different medication. 

My big fear (and it might sound dumb) is that I’m afraid getting on a Zoloft or Prozac will change my personality. I’m very type A and outgoing and part of why I liked Wellbutrin was because I feel like me on it. (I obviously don’t feel like me right now though.) And I have no bad sexual side effects on it. Lexapro side effects fucked me up before I tried Wellbutrin so I think that’s where my fears come from. I also journal every day, and plan to get a referral for a therapist while I’m at the doc tomorrow. But I know new meds are what I need. I’m just scared.

HKate_Engineer,"My LO is 6 weeks old today. I am struggling to not cry daily. I feel like I failed as a mom at every turn and my husband is very helpful (we switch on and off for sleeping) but is kind of hands off when it comes to what he is thinking about situations like breastfeeding and things like that. 

I had a ""failed induction"" ending up in a c-section after over 40 hours of labor. I felt like a failure for my body not responding correctly. Then when we got home, our LO started having latching issues.  I had to get 2 nipple shields to see if it could help and it did a little.  She still eats for over an hour and shows all signs of being full (falling asleep, hands open, milk drunk) but when I burp her she screams and roots for more milk. We end up giving her a bottle while I pump. After nursing I can get about the same amount of milk as I normally can without nursing. I can tell she is getting milk because she is swallowing but it's not enough clearly.  

We found out she has a slight lip, tongue, and bucal ties so we got the lip tie corrected and she showed little improvement. She still latches for a long time and isn't getting enough.  She won't even take my natural breast anymore, just screams and ends up making me cry. 

I think I don't have a choice but to exclusively pump if I want to give her breast milk.  I hate the thought of having to pump to provide for her but it seems like the only option.  I'm not formula shaming (we top off with formula frequently) but I really want to not have to bring my pump and wash all of those parts and all of that.  It would be so much easier to just latch her but it didn't work for her.

togipeach,"Growing up i always knew I'd be a good mum, I am definitely the maternal type and I had young siblings to help take care of so I knew I wanted a family of my own some day. 

I have two children now, both times were unplanned. I was not ready to become a mother the first time around but I felt like I had no choice , my mental health was in shambles and I knew if I got a termination I would have ended up killing myself. I toughed through it on my own (it was a casual fling, nothing serious and he was very toxic)

And you know what, it wasn't that bad. It was definitely a shock to the system but it made me stronger in every way that I needed. Fast forward to my first being 9 months old and I'd started seeing someone. We began dating and within 3 months I fell pregnant on accident.  I was extremely paranoid about falling pregnant because I was not ready and didn't want another child so close in age or so soon into a relationship. He'd always wanted a family, he left his wife of a few years as she changed her mind about wanting a family. I felt guilt. I knew he'd be happy or excited but I wasn't in any way. I told him in a nice way so I guess he took it as a means to tell his family and what not so I felt backed into a corner before we even had a discussion about what we were going to do. 

This unplanned pregnancy affected me negatively in literally every single way and all the doors that felt like they were starting to open for me slammed right in my face.i had to get rid of a car I absolutely loved, spend less time with my first, I could no longer study,  my work was affected, my mental health declined hard and fast. I feel like I dissociated for a lot of the pregnancy and used video games as a distraction. I got gestational diabetes, My only birth plan was pain relief and it didn't happen, our breastfeeding journey was short and painful. I feel so much resentment towards this baby and my partner. I can't tell if I feel this way because of post natal depression or if its because I genuinely feel this way and its not going to go away. I need help and I don't know what to do. 

I hate my life, I have no time alone to myself, I have no drive to do the things I love. I just feel like I exist to look after my kids. I get so angry and upset at her so fast. Its not her fault, she's just a sweet little baby who didn't ask for any of this. I love her but I wish her and her dad would just go. It breaks my heart to say that in a place where people can see it and it makes it real but its how I feel. I care about my partner but I don't want to be a mum of 2 I hate this so much. I don't want to feel this way

There are days where I just feel like crying, days where I don't feel like getting up out of bed, and the most recent feeling I've had to deal with is that of distrust. He's never given me a reason to distrust him, but I can't help it. It's like I'm looking to catch him in a lie and when I don't get the results I'm looking for I get upset. I even went as far as to snoop through his phone after he had fallen asleep, and when nothing came up I felt...insulted ?

I’m just having a really hard time. I know the lockdowns and COVID made everything ten times worse. My daughter was born by a traumatic C section, which started me off on a difficult note. She had allergic colitis with mucusy bloody poops (thankfully she’s grown out of and is almost 1) and so I had to cut wheat, dairy egg and soy from my diet for almost a year. Now, at an appointment about a month ago I found out she lost two ounces instead of gaining. I breastfeed (pump too) and was giving her just veggies for solids at the advice of her GI specialist in addition to the breast milk. Of course I talked to the doctor and we modified her diet (she’s slowly gaining now) but I feel like the absolute worst mother. Like I was starving her. Her doctors said she is fine but I can’t get over it. I feel like I failed her you know? Every time I look at her I just think what a failure of a mother I am. Oh yeah and she’s almost a year old and still not crawling on hands and knees. Everyone is like, is she walking yet? And I hate having to answer them. I’ve dealt with crippling anxiety and depression for almost a year now. Idk what to do.

teachertraveler811,"Hi everyone,
I’m just having a really hard time. I know the lockdowns and COVID made everything ten times worse. My daughter was born by a traumatic C section, which started me off on a difficult note. She had allergic colitis with mucusy bloody poops (thankfully she’s grown out of and is almost 1) and so I had to cut wheat, dairy egg and soy from my diet for almost a year. Now, at an appointment about a month ago I found out she lost two ounces instead of gaining. I breastfeed (pump too) and was giving her just veggies for solids at the advice of her GI specialist in addition to the breast milk. Of course I talked to the doctor and we modified her diet (she’s slowly gaining now) but I feel like the absolute worst mother. Like I was starving her. Her doctors said she is fine but I can’t get over it. I feel like I failed her you know? Every time I look at her I just think what a failure of a mother I am. Oh yeah and she’s almost a year old and still not crawling on hands and knees. Everyone is like, is she walking yet? And I hate having to answer them. I’ve dealt with crippling anxiety and depression for almost a year now. Idk what to do. Being alone in the house with her (I’m a teacher and so off for the summer now) makes me feel utterly lonely and helpless.

My husband works a high demand military job where he is gone up to 19 hrs/day. We are new to where we are living and I have yet to make a single friend. We have no family nearby and I don’t really feel like they care to be supportive or be involved, even from a distance. I feel so isolated and like a horrible mom.

I was diagnosed early on thank goodness (I have a history of anxiety disorder too), so I’ve been experimenting with medications and going to therapy. The past couple weeks I’ve been feeling some better but of course still have some bad days. But for some reason yesterday and today it almost feels like I’ve backslid almost to the beginning again. I keep telling myself it’s a huge accomplishment that I’ve made it almost 4 months and I’m proud of myself for that. I normally know I will end up recovering, but days like today make me think I’m never going to get better. I quit my job because of this and am financially relying on my husband. I feel guilty for putting all the pressure on him so I wonder if this contributes to my anxiety/depression. He is an angel and reassures me that he is completely fine with me staying home with the kids and that I need time to heal. I’m just impatient and want to heal soon so we can get back to normal. This is my second child but first time having PPD so it’s all new and scary to me. Please send some positive vibes my way! I don’t want to feel like this forever.

momma-yo,"\*Vent Post if allowed\* I am having a really hard time. The first few months were rough. Jaundice, Colic, bad formula, you name it and it happened. I knew I was prone to getting PPD because I have felt the blues before. I been hesitant to getting help. I finally went ahead and looked into some resources some one recommended from another sub. The only time I have spoken to a therapist was when I went through a break up and started some reckless behavior. 

Yesterday I had a really good day with my kids. We played Candy Land and danced. The baby didn't cry or anything he played with us. Today I woke up tired and realized my house was a mess. I yelled and I screamed. I said things I didn't mean and I felt like a s\*\*t person. I have an online appt with a therapist Tuesday. I need help because I just can't shake these emotions and bad thoughts from my head. I have always been a positive happy person and I just can't find myself. It could be that I became a stay at home mom. It could be that maybe I have no one to talk too. I tried journaling again and it helps for the moment. 

I have spent all week reading post after post on how others relate and it scares me. Scares me that I will never shake this feeling. I don't feel like doing anything nor do I feel like leaving my house also. My area sucks. People here suck in South FL. 

My twenty's have been eventful. Got married young. Went to Europe. Had baby. Came back. Found out my ex husband had a secret relationship with my ex bff. Got divorced. Got pregnant with ex. Jumped back and found myself spiritually. Met some one (good guy). Broke up and found bad guy. Got into drugs. Got off drugs. Got back with good guy. Got pregnant again. Here we are. Sounds like a horrible novel. Sounds like maybe I am a little off. Promise I am really awkward and calm when I first interact with any one. 

This depression how ever. It's like a bad secret. It's anxiety. It's anger burst. It's happy days and with a dash of energy. Then tiredness. I know me I am not this person. I want to be who I truly am inside. The person I know I always been and could be. The giver, The nice girl that helps everyone out and the great mom I know I can be. 

I am sorry for my un-organized long rant. Air sign problems. Thanks for listening. It really helped.",Postpartum_Depression,PPD and life *a vent*,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/nygs1m/ppd_and_life_a_vent/,1623557679.0,2021-06-12 21:14:39,

My husband just got a job which means we no longer qualify for low cost healthcare but make too much to afford healthcare. And yes, I've already reached out to my state healthcare authority and multiple insurance companies. While my 4.5 month old daughter can get healthcare still thank the gods, my husband and I can't. My husband has liver failure. He need regular doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, medications, blood tests, and endoscopies we can't afford. I have epilepsy, IBS, fibromyalgia, and a whole battery of mental illnesses. This means we can't afford any of my husband's medications to keep his liver from being more fucked up. We can't afford any of his treatments or procedures. We can't afford the medications that keep me from having grand mal seizures multiple times per week. We can't afford for me to seek mental healthcare. We can't afford shit. And no, I can't get a job because childcare is too expensive.

The staff said I had ""been there three days"" I could not urinate on my own as I had nerve damage. I wish I sued the shit out of the hospital but I couldn't relive the trauma. It has been 5 years.

Anyways. I’m 1 month postpartum and I also have a 2 year old. Husband (B) got a vasectomy on Friday. I babied him all that day. Let him stay in bed, didn’t ask him to help with kids, dinner in bed, everything. 

Next day, Saturday was our daughters 2nd birthday, and so I spent late Friday night decorating. B usually does the midnight feeding, I do the 3 am, he’ll do the 6 am and then I’ll get up with both girls when they wake around 8. But since he was in lots of pain I did the midnight, the 6 am and got up with the girls at 8. He only did the 3 am because I cried hysterically and told him I couldn’t do it. 

On Saturday things went pretty well for the party but he only helped with a little here and there, ok fine. Sunday comes around and he did almost nothing. He slept in super late, didn’t do the 6 am feeding, and didn’t help in the morning either, even though he has the day off. Spent the rest of the day researching phones because his broke. I spent the day tidying our messy apartment after from the party. Sunday night, I told him how upset I was because usually on Sundays I get a little break. (I.e. he does the majority of the diaper changes, gets them dressed). But today I didn’t. He said “well, I just had surgery two days ago, it’s normal to go easy after a surgery.” And I said “but I didn’t get to do nothing after I gave birth. I still had to take care of the kids when we got home.” He said he would try to do better. 

That leads us to Sunday night/this morning. Usually when he does the midnight feeding, he will set out the pre measured bottles and formula. But he didn’t do any of that so at 3 am I’m trying to hunt down bottles and measure. 2 year old was having a crappy night so I got up every time with her too. This morning, both girls decide to wake up extra early, extra grouchy. Husband doesn’t move to get up. I said “I need your help. I just can’t do it this morning. I’m exhausted from the weekend.” He said he would help, but took ten minutes to actually get out of bed. He came back to bed and slept in. Slept way past his first client (he’s a CNA) and called in sick with them. 

He came in the living room at 10:30 and I’m holding a fussy baby while my toddler eats breakfast and I told him “you better hurry home today cuz as soon as you get home I’m going to runaway.” He asked what I meant and I said “this weekend was brutal, I barely got any help and I’m exhausted. I want to runaway. I’m done being your wife and I’m done being their mom. I want to runaway.” I then mentioned how upset I was he slept in and took his client off. He just kept mentioning recovering from his vasectomy. 

Maybe I’m being heartless about his vasectomy but he literally told me that he didn’t even need any pain meds the day after and I’m over here still recovering from childbirth and still have stitches inside me. I know I just need some sleep and maybe I’ll feel better but I can’t seem to find time. All I want to do is runaway, get a room at a hotel and sleep.

Justasmoltowngurl,"After a traumatic delivery I knew something was wrong but I wasn't sure what. I didn't feel bonded with my daughter but I was assured this was normal and it would come with time. The first two weeks I didn't get to be with her much, I was readdmited to the ER with an infection and my husband and I didn't want her admitted so she could be with me.

After I got home and started my bed rest to prevent hemorrhaging, I started to panic when ever I wasn't with her, I was scared someone would drop her or who ever was watching her would fall asleep and she would be smothered. I shook these off tho. As the months went on, those fears got worse. I started to think people were going to break in to kidnap her, or someone was trying to kill her. I still didn't feel bonded, I just felt stuck. I started to plan my way out, but real plan it. I was going to have my husband watch her and I would drive up into the mountains and just, well I am sure you can assume. When she was around 6 months old, the hallucinations started. I would see a man in the room with me and my baby, I assumed it was my husband. This happened for days before I asked my husband why he wouldn't talk to me when he came in at night.

I still didn't know there was something wrong. My husband felt like he lost his wife, but we didn't think PPD, PPA and Pp psychosis could happen to me.

When my daughter turned 1 I finally felt some what bonded with her. I loved her and cared for her at this point. But I truly believed my husband would be able to raise our daughter much better without me in the picture. I told him how I felt, how I had a plan, how truly unstable I felt. So he did what needed to be done and locked all of our fire arms in the safe and changed the passwords. And wouldn't leave me alone with our daughter. Tho I never wanted to hurt her. It was around this time my hallucinations went away.

I still didn't get help.

I didn't get help until my daughter turned 3.5 years old, she is 4 now. I am on medication and am trying to find a therapist. During those years I was so torn and mentally ill. I feel like I missed out on her early life, I wasn't present. I was so scared of her dying, being hurt, messing up and traumatizing her for life, someone kidnapping her, someone hurting her and me not knowing, and wanting to end my life, I wasn't there even tho I was.

I am better now. I have anxiety and panic attacks once a month. But with medication I only have a deppresive episode once a month or every other month. It takes time, but there is hope. We missed all the symptoms because we didn't think it could happen to me. Know the symptoms, tell everyone the symptoms, so you can get help even if you don't see it.

I feel like I ruin everything and ruin everyone’s day by just being around and it just seems like things would be better if I wasn’t here. As a result of the the postpartum depression I have gained 120 pounds. My boyfriend works constantly and he usually only has 2 days off once a week and when he is off he expects me to cook and clean the house and take care of the kids while trying to make him feel good. Last night he caught me eating a tub of Neapolitan Ice cream, he slapped the spoon out of my hand and began to call a disgrace and he said that I was a disgusting person for eating like a pig. He then grabbed my back rolls (which I am the most self conscious about) and said if I continue to gain weight he will leave me and the kids by ourselves.

Purple-Associate5695,"I’m a 30yo female. I’ve had weakness and fatigue since about 2 months after I had my first baby. He is almost 2 years old now and it hasn’t gone away. I have good days and bad days. It’s not sleepiness, it’s just that I feel like I have no energy/strength. Kind of like the exhaustion and fatigue that comes with the flu. 

I’ve already had a lot of blood work done that came back fine but I’m going back to the doctor in a couple weeks because I’m so miserable. 

The doctors I’ve seen conclude it is due to my anxiety mixed with some depression. I’m in therapy currently, but the fatigue persists. It seems to get worse during and shortly after my monthly cycle each month. It also tends to be worse in the morning. Showers also drain me. 

I don’t feel like I lack motivation to do things because of my mood, but because I feel so bad physically. I’m a stay at home mom.

Istartbutneverfini,"I had a baby a year ago and started experiencing post partum depression almost immediately. I stopped breastfeeding and I was put on Sertraline and have been on it for about 3 months. I felt fine at first - great actually! So focused but not overly concentrated.

LetmeusethenameIwant,"*vent post with trigger warning* 

Posted some pictures on facebook of my little and me, keeping up the happy facade and all that. And an acquaintance commented “motherhood looks good on you” under one of the photos. I know it was meant well and as a compliment, but it keeps turning over in my head. 

Motherhood looks good on me? I think about offing myself every time he wakes up at night and whenever I get overwhelmed, which with everything on my plate is constantly. I’m counting down the days till we can sleep train but I’m also super guilty about that and if I’ll ruin our attachment like every person against sleep training screams at me about. 

I don’t resent my baby but I resent myself for bringing him into the world with a shit mom like I am. No matter what I do it never seems enough.

 I’m exhausted. The baby refuses to sleep without being held. He flat refuses safe sleep in general and its a fight to get him to sleep anywhere actually safe. He’s cluster feeding and I exclusively pump so even when he does sleep, I can’t. I’m in school trying to keep my head above water with this class that is imperative to my career and education that can’t be dropped and taken another time. On top of cooking meals because otherwise I don’t get to eat, and cleaning because my partner could live in a dumpster and be fine but that’s not a safe or healthy environment for anyone. Then balancing my families bullshit because as the eldest child, the responsibility falls to me. I sleep maybe 2 hours a night which I know is half the problem with how I’m feeling. 

I’m nothing of who I was. I refuse to look in the mirror cuz I hate what I see. This tiny human deserves so much more than I can offer. He deserves a better mom. But having someone take over makes me feel like a failure, why can’t I get it together and keep it all handled and be good enough. 

If I say anything to anyone in my life they push for meds or inpatient and inpatient, being as the only inpatient in this area is at my place of work, isn’t an option without it destroying my career at this building. I want to avoid meds as it can later affect my career if it were to be found out somehow (the stigma is horribly massive in this area, most of all in the providers who work with these cases daily because they are so overwhelmed with it).

Because of that combined with PTSD caused by traumatic, abusive treatment in the hospital during pregnancy, labor, and afterwards.

The-Chonky-one,"HUGE TRIGGER WARNING - graphic blunt talk about thoughts I had post partum please do not read if you do not think you’re in the headspace for it 

I’m well out of the PPD/A (I had both) fog, babygirl is 21 months old now. I’ve briefly shared my story in some parts of the internet, but I was inspired by a YouTuber I watch (rawbeautykristi) being so candid and blunt and just feel inspired. I hope that by sharing all the horrible details, I can help another mother going through the same. 

I had my girl the summer of 2019. I had the most easy pregnancy you could ask for, gained very little weight, no health issues, glowing skin, no morning sickness. The only gripe I could even think of was some off and on heartburn. My husband and family were all so supportive, my husband researched birth/breastfeeding with me and was so educated on all of it, my family rallied around me and lifted me up. I was on cloud 9. I was also lucky enough to go into labor naturally exactly one day after my due date, as a first time mom. Get to the hospital, lucky again and I’m already 3 CM dilated and 100% effaced after just a few hours of labor. Water breaks in triage. Labor until pain gets to be too much, get an EPI - which was placed quickly and painlessly by the most kind doctor I could ask for. 

Tried to rest once I was numb, but the anxiety of giving birth soon was too much and I couldn’t. I was going on 16+ hours without sleep, but the labor high kept me going and I hardly noticed. Morning comes, and I’m fully dilated and ready to push. Push her out in less than 20 mins, she comes out screaming, pink, and healthy. A chonk of a baby, almost 9 lbs and 22 inches long. I had one tiny, tiny baby tear. No complications, no hemorrhaging, Textbook easy birth.  All the nurses kept saying I labored and birthed like a 2nd or 3rd time mom instead of a first. I felt soooo good. 

I rode that oxytocin high for about a day and half to two days. Said what a lot of us do shortly after birth “I want another one” “I could do this a million times”. Baby had some issues transferring the sticky colostrum, so I did have to pump and triple feed some feedings - but I had tons of colostrum. Once again - soooo lucky. 

We get home, and it’s at this point I start coming down - fast. I realize just how little sleep I’ve gotten in 4-5 days. Maybe two hours? If that? The anxiety slowly starts creeping in. Will I ever sleep again? How can I sleep with her cluster feeding so often? I can’t co-sleep, she’ll suffocate and die! 

Sleep when baby sleeps. Okay. I lay her down in her bassinet, she’s such an easy baby and naps for two hours for me. I lay down, close my eyes, and suddenly realize I CANT SLEEP because what if she stops breathing? It will be my fault for not watching her! Rinse and repeat for the rest of the day.

My milk finally comes in on day two home. Soooo much milk. She’s nursing like a champ. But I start feeling... sick. Sick with love. Sick from utter, chronic, debilitating sleep deprivation - I had maybe had 3 hours of scattered sleep in one week, if that. Sick with anxiety, I was convinced she would either stop breathing in her sleep or I would fall asleep nursing and suffocate her. I felt like a monster for not feeling the high I felt after birth. I was crashing. 

To be honest, I can’t remember exactly when it started to go beyond baby blues. It was quick, I know that. I started regretting having her. I loved her so much it physically hurt, but I also wished I never had her. I thought I would never sleep again. I would never feel normal again. I would never not be sick with debilitating anxiety again. 

I started to get horrible, horrible intrusive images in my head. Images of people hurting her in every way you can imagine (yes- EVERY way), imagines of ME hurting her, her dad hurting her. The most horrible one I struggled with was this - I’d picture me taking a gun, shooting her, then shooting myself in the head. This image flashed in my head atleast every 5 minutes. I tried so, so hard to fight it. Id try to picture a flower coming out of the gun. It never worked. I also kept getting horrible images of me dropping her and her skull cracking open. Over and over and over. Once again, I tried my best to reframe it. I’d picture her falling onto a soft, fluffy cloud. But my brain would intercept, the cloud wouldn’t hold, and she’d fall to the ground. 

I felt like I was fighting a demon in my head. I loved her, why was I thinking these thoughts? Were they my thoughts? I love her so much I can’t even sleep for fear of her dying, but when I close my eyes I see myself killing her? What is going on? Why did no women prepare me for this? Why, on Gods green earth, did I ever fucking think having a baby was a good idea? This is the worst decision I ever made, I will never be normal again. I’m an idiot. I’m a bad mom. I’m a bad wife. My daughter doesn’t deserve a mom like this. Look at how happy my husband is to be a dad, I’m a piece of shit for feeling this way. Maybe I should kill myself. Then atleast I won’t feel this way anymore, and if I’m dead, I can’t hurt her. She’ll be safe if I’m dead. But wait, I don’t want to die! What do I do? 

This was my inner monologue, on repeat, mixed with horrific, horror movie level intrusive thoughts of different scenarios happening to my daughter and myself. Oh yeah, and chronic sleep deprivation that would make prisoners of war shudder. 

Day 4-6 idfk home and my dad stops by. I’m in a daze. I’m hating everything about this, I’m hating myself, hating her, but loving her so damn much at the same time. It all made no fucking sense. My dad asks me if I’m okay, and the dam broke. I SOBBED. I wailed. I told him, and my husband, everything. I couldn’t hold back. I had to get it out. I couldn’t do it anymore. 

I kept saying “I don’t want them to take my baby” listen here and now women - THEY WONT TAKE YOUR BABY. You don’t have to suffer. I repeat, THEY WILL NOT TAKE YOUR BABY. We call a therapist family friend, he says I sound like I have very severe PPD and he wants me to go straight to the hospital. I would lick satans asshole to feel better at this point, so despite the fear of losing her to CPS - I go. I leave my sweet baby girl at home with her grandpa, heartbroken and missing her so much it hurts before I even get to the car, and go to the hospital. 

We get there. Get checked in. Get to the poorly ran phyc ward. They take my jewelry. They cut my beautiful custom day collar my husband had made for me (we didn’t have the key), permanently ruining it. As if I could kill myself with it. I wait 4 hours for a social worker to ask me the standard questions. Visiting time is up, and my husband has to leave. This is when it all hits me. I sob, and tell him to tell our baby girl mommy loves her so much and I’m doing this so I can be a better mommy for her. Id never seen my husband so helpless. It broke my heart into a million pieces. 

I pump while there, while nurses stare me down because apparently you can kill yourself with a breast pump. A delusional man stares in my room all night. I’m scared of him. I hide under the blanket, and a nurse comes in and scolds me and tells me I can’t hide my face. I sleep backwards (foot by headboard head by footboard) so he can’t see me. Somehow I pass out from sheer exhaustion. 

Morning comes. My dad visits while husband is home with baby. My dad looked so fucking helpless and worried sick for me, my God I love that man - I could not ask for a better dad. But seeing the worry, hurt, anxiety, and anger (over how I was being treated by the hospital) on his face just broke me again. 

I get transferred to a mental health hospital type place. They put me in the unit for fucking drug addicts. I get there, and people are fighting, high, withdrawing from drugs. I’m petrified. I’m bleeding, my breasts are swollen and leaking, I miss my baby more than anything I’ve ever missed in my entire life, and I’m surrounded by unstable (mostly male - they didn’t separate by gender there) drug addicts. My dad and husband come to see me there, while step mom/grandma watches baby. THANK GOD FOR MY VILLAGE. My dad is ENRAGED to see me in this unit. They said the depression unit had no beds. My dad pulls a nurse to the side, and somehow, I have no idea - he gets me transferred. Once again, I love my dad sooo fucking much. He is my hero. 

I get to the depression unit. It’s slightly better. I find out despite being promised a short 3 day stay so I can get medicated and stabilized and quickly return to my baby who needs me, I’m going to be forced to stay 6 fucking days because I came before a weekend. I felt the world crashing down around me. I could not be away from my baby that long. I broke. I managed to get a private chat with the head therapist, and begged him to let me go home. I had support, I promised to go straight to therapy, take my meds, sleep, take the help from family and my husband. His hands were tied, I guess. So I stay. I feel like a prisoner. I will never, ever judge someone who’s served time again. What I felt there, not being unable to leave, was the most dehumanizing feeling I can imagine. I don’t have words for it. I can’t imagine doing that for months or years. 

I manage to get some good ass sleep there, and I think that’s what helped me the most. The sleep deprivation really amplified everything I was feeling. The meds helped as well. We do bullshit group therapy, I’m surrounded by young adults with severe mental health issues who can’t relate to my post partum issues as an old mom at all so it really didn’t do much for me. I get like two “sessions” with the psychologist which is just asking the most basic questions you can ask.

What also helped me a lot, was pumping. It made me feel like I was atleast doing something for her while I was there. My husband picked the milk up everyday after visiting me. God bless him. A new dad, dealing with a newborn, and a sick wife who was being forced to stay somewhere away from her newborn. It was so traumatic for him, too. While I pumped, nurses had to sit with me. I did love the nurses. Every one of them, every fucking single one, told me they had the exact same thoughts after their baby. One nurse said “i remember about a week after I had my daughter, I was so so tired and sitting there rocking my sweet little baby, and I looked down at her precious face and thought ‘now I understand why some moms throw their babies out of windows’ “ I felt so validated and heard by these women during our pumping conversations. Another nurse who was from the Middle East told me how hard she struggled, and how she couldn’t talk about it in her home country because no one believes PPD is real there. She said she felt she never really recovered from the trauma of it because she had to fight tooth and nail through it with no help at all. But, while I felt validated and heard, I also felt very, very angry. If this is so common, why did no one prepare me? Why did my OBGYN not mention it? Why did my stepmom, aunt, mother, coworkers, cousin or anyone else tell me to watch out for it? Or that it was normal, treatable, and common? WHY? Why did no one, especially other mothers, ask me how I was feeling mentally after birth? Not a single mother asked me. It took my dad asking me for me to get help. 

Towards the end of my stay, I get the most amazing surprise I can ever ask for. A visit with my beautiful baby girl. I tear up now thinking about it. It was short, and she slept the whole time on my chest, and they didn’t allow me to nurse her, but it gave me the strength I needed to keep going. 

The 6th day comes and I get to leave. The second I walk out those doors, hand in hand with my amazing, blessing of a husband, I know I can do it. Would I feel good every day? No. Would I still get anxiety and depression, and intrusive to thoughts? Yes. But I will make it though. And I did. And you will too.",Postpartum_Depression,I wanna share my story,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mxx605/i_wanna_share_my_story/,1619337003.0,2021-04-25 00:50:03,2.8240540285081764e+18
deadhoe9,"So my PPA/PPD has been getting a lot better with a combo of meds and therapy and I've been doing a great job controlling my emotions and triggers. But today I am PISSED. So, my husband has 2 brothers and 1 sister. Today my husband was talking to his sister, we'll call her ""Karah"", and told him about something fucked up his brother's wife, we'll call her ""Ella"", said about our baby/us as parents. If it's unclear, Ella is the asshole SIL.



For context, Ella is just an asshole in general. She physically assaulted my husband's brother because he was listening to rap music and according to her it's racist for white people to listen to rap (she's white btw). Like she straight up slapped him in the face and started wailing on him unprovoked just because she heard him pull up in his car listening to rap. She also once got black put drunk and took a shit in her husband's crock pot to ""get back at him"" for talking to another girl at a family gathering. Who was that girl? HIS FUCKING COUSIN. So clearly she's not a very nice person.



Well, apparently a few minutes after we announced over group text to our families that our baby had arrived and we were all safe and healthy, she calls up Karah and straight up tells her that my husband and I being parents is going to end badly for us and our baby and that she didn't think we were fit to be parents. She never said why or elaborated, just dropped that bomb on what was the happiest moment of my husband and I's life literally MINUTES after our baby was born. Who tf does that??? Karah is awesome and went off on her and shut that shit down immediately, telling her it wasn't cool what she said and that she's lucky she's even allowed in the family at all after the shit she pulled. Imo Ella lucky we live on the other side of the country and that I didn't find out that she said that until I was 3 months PP and doing better mentally or else she would get an earful and then some.

Catzy94,"I’ve posted in here a few times about having postpartum and dealing with CPS due to using marijuana to cope with it. I was starting to feel a little better and even got an appointment booked for this Monday with a psychiatrist.

Yesterday I had to put my dog down. He was only seven and I was not ready. I know I gave him a good life. He was spoiled rotten and traveled everywhere with me. If you’ve ever seen the Pixar short called Winston, not only did Bebop look like that, but he ate like that. Everyone loved him because he couldn’t abide people being sad. I’m pretty sure he was convinced dog slobber applied directly to the face via tongue could cure anything.

Putting him down was hard but I stayed with him. Fortunately my area has low COVID numbers so my partner and our son came in with me. The last picture I have of Bebop is my son petting him. It was weird to have the vet techs cooing over my son while trying to be sympathetic about my dog.

Now it’s raining cats, dogs and small children and there’s a tornado watch issued for my county. We moved here last August so this is our first storm season here. I’ve lived in South Texas most of my life so I’m used to hurricanes, not tornadoes.

With a hurricane, you get weeks of warning and I know how to prepare for them. I keep a binder with all our important documents and a checklist for evacuations. The second the national weather service projects over a Cat 2, I board up and get the hell out. The hurricanes I’ve been through have caused tornadoes, but I’ve never seen one because I always evacuate. I only see the damage when I come back.

Being in East Texas now, we’re too far from the Gulf for hurricanes. That was one of the reasons I wanted to move here. But I know nothing about tornadoes. The extent of my knowledge comes from the movie Twister.

We’re safe but seriously what did I do to piss off the universe? Which planet is acting up and causing this mess? Is Mercury in Gatorade again? On the bright side there’s so much wrong that it’s becoming hilarious. That’s giving me some relief from my depression.

dykgdwryjkogrsseh,"This is my second time posting here. Last time I got the most amazing support i have ever received in my life so i thought i would try to reach out again.

I read online that writing a letter to your loved ones would help deal with any unwanted thoughts and make you realize how much you have to be grateful for.  Mine turned into a good bye letter to my husband and 11 months son. I cried all morning but it did not make me want to stick around any more - it had the opposite effect.

I'm so tired of my circumstances and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

My husband's family is awful and for reasons i don't want to get into we live with his parents. My mother in law has wanted this since we started dating. They are very paranoid people and do not want anyone to know anything about them. This is why I haven't shared anything with anyone about my situation. They also speak a second language in the house that i don't understand. 

My mother-in-law picks at me every day all day. I'm not walking my son enough, I'm walking him to much. Why did you not feed him?! He's not hungry why are you giving him food?! The way she askes questions set me up to fail. Are you giving him egg? Me , sure he can have egg. Don't you know he had it already?! (I work full Time and dont know what she feeds him unless she tells me)then she goes to my husband and tells him how bad mother i am. 

She has been doing this behind my back for a while. When she does not get her Way she slams doors and ignored me. 

Last time she ignored me for three days because my baby woke up at 5 am and cried. She got up and told my husband in their language that i was a bad mother, i was tramatizing my baby and grabbed him and took him to her bedroom. I tried to get him back but she would not give him to me until someone else interwened. They yelled and hit things i thought the police would get called.

I told my husband that we need to leave but he keeps dragging it out. He wants to wait for the end of summer so we can all call it of with dignity and to get our afairs in order.

Catzy94,"I posted recently about my old therapist reporting me to CPS for medicating my postpartum with marijuana. The report was made last Friday, it’s now Wednesday. I had an appointment already scheduled before she called me about the report and decided to go through with it.

I needed her to see what her report did to me. The pre-screening before my last appointment showed me stabilizing. I had a high score for risk assessment this week. I openly told her that I have plans for suicide that I will follow through on if CPS removes my son. I told her flat out that if her report causes me to lose custody, my blood will be squarely in her hands.

Despite that, it went surprisingly well. She kept trying to reassure me that her report stated that she didn’t think I should lose custody and that I am a fit mother, I’m just struggling with postpartum. It’s very weird to have the very person who shattered your world try to convince you that everything’s going to be okay.

She told me she wrestled with herself for a long time before making the report. I pointed out that she says she thinks I’m a fit mother, so what was the point of the report? What did she expect to come out of it? She could never really answer that.

I’ve seen this doctor for years. She’s seen me survive homelessness, abuse, rape, and multiple suicide attempts. I have never been this bad off and I know she could see it. She tried to tell me she didn’t intend to harm me. I pointed out that her intentions didn’t matter. Regardless of her intentions, her actions threatened my custody, and therefore my life.

It felt good to know that she sees the harm she did. She tried to say that she’s on my side and would even contact CPS for an update so I can stop being anxious. That she would tell them again she didn’t think I should lose custody. And she tried to get me an emergency appointment with my old psychiatrist for medication. I finally relented just before the end of our conversation but I haven’t signed the forms allowing her to contact them. I pointed out that trying to get me an emergency appointment came with the risk of involuntary commitment. How can I trust anyone to help me after her report?

I’m so exhausted but I’m cuddled up with my son right now. He’s been fussy all day and I think it’s because he’s somewhat aware of how much I’m suffering. I was laying in my bed a few feet away and he reached for him. That’s the first time he’s done that. I melted. Now he’s fussing for me to pay attention to him instead of my phone so I’ll stop rambling.

Luunaer,"I've suffered with depression for about 10 years of my life. And never chosen to be medicated just because I've been a counsellor and I don't feel like it would help me. I also don't want to take a drug which gives me false emotions and I also feel like I enjoy punishing myself to some degree so I can control something.

I feel like these days we live in such a thankless world. Where people don't appreciate others and people seem to be very selfish. I think tbh the Internet hasn't helped. I also feel like no one really truly listens. And I've always been a great listener, great at giving advice... Labeled as ""the strong one"". And to be honest I'm totally drowning.

I don't want to go to the NHS for help because I've been a counsellor before and if I get stuck with someone feeding the same lines to every person it'd just make things worse. So I'm hoping coming here, even if it's just to hear I'm not the only one and I can vent to someone then maybe I can get through my days. Sorry this will be a long post.

I have 3 children. (15, almost 4 and 2). I've run a business since I was 18 and now I'm 32. I've worked part time in the evenings when my kids go to bed for the last 4 years since my middle son was born. And tbh I have never really been a maternal person in the sense of my children are my identity and all I want in life is children. My depression got much worse when my youngest was born. I had a horrific birth and we both almost died. And not that I went into a deep depression because of me, I went into a worse depression because I was thinking what if my son had died. I spent about 6 months when he was 3 months old going out every weekend and getting drunk and I just didn't want to be home. I didn't want to face reality. Of course, when I was at home I put a smile on my face and pretended I was fine but it almost broke off my 11 year relationship because I was too selfish. I needed time for myself, to be me not just a mum. Which is the most thankless and under appreciated job in the world. Being a woman is hard enough, being a mother, a partner, a caretaker, a cleaner, a chef, everyone's rock and their support system is taxing and I literally have nothing for myself. No identity. No life other than my kids.

After my 6m of going out I was really happy and then covid hit and I had to close my business in January. Not that that's a negative I'm now retraining into programming and I'm looking on the bright side because my middle child goes to school in September full time. However every day I'm forcing myself to wake up, to be a parent and give them everything they need but I'm not looking after myself. I've gained weight, I often can't even be bothered to brush my hair, I don't wear makeup and I'm just sad ALL the time. I'm sat here balling my eyes out because I literally can't do it anymore. I keep telling myself it's only 4 months but it feels like I'm not going to make it. I want to get a new job so badly so I can work full time just to get away from the kids. So that I can be me again and for the days I spend with them I want to give my all. But at the moment I just can't do that. I can't even be bothered to clean.

I've told myself I've just got to get up and be positive but I've reached the point where I can't do that. And I just need someone to talk to. Someone who doesn't pretend their life is perfect, someone I can be real with and someone who can be real with me.

My partner is amazing, he's supportive etc but I just don't think he gets it. He isn't a woman, women are wired differently and we're wired to just get on with it and multitask.

BoomBunnie,"I've been doing pretty well lately. I've been working extremely hard on myself - making sure I use self-care, going easy on myself, seeing a therapist once a week, journaling, drawing, playing video games...all that on top of being a mom has been pretty exhausting, but its working. My relationships are getting better, I'm starting to feel connected to people again. I even finally had an orgasm which has been EXTREMELY long since I've been able to...but tonight when watching the new episode of this show, it sent me into a weird spiral. When I reached out to try to talk things through with someone, it didn't really work. I'm getting the feeling they're tired of hearing about it. Which made me feel pretty miserable. I know that's probably my self-doubt and PPD talking - but it sucks nonetheless. I'd like to go back to where I was earlier today. I felt like I was kicking ass. All this week really! I don't want to spiral, and I'm trying extremely hard right now not to lose it. 

In the episode, the character with PPD talked about how it was logical for her to feel like a good mother, but she just didn't feel it. That hit me pretty hard as something I feel. The thing she said that I resonated most with was how hard she worked to overcome so many things, but this one thing that she can't deal with alone. That very thing kills me. I've fought so hard to overcome so much, is PPD what's going to take me out? It feels like it sometimes. Before lately, it felt like it was definitely going to do me in...every day. 

It brought me back to how I was fantasizing about dying and a new better mother/wife came to take my place and how much better my family would be doing with her. Of course, I imagine her beautiful, smart, charming, and outstanding mother...perfect really. Which doesn't exist. It just hurt, and it made me feel so lonely, and like such a huge burden. 

I live with severe gastroparesis. Pain every day. And other health issues. I've survived a surgery gone terribly wrong that resulted in life-changing hardships. I would do all of that over again 10x to not have to deal with post partum depression anymore. This is the worst I've ever felt.

I hated breast feeding so I stopped. Every time someone asks about it, I get so defensive and give like 20 reason other than ""I just didn't like it"" to explain myself. 

I had a c section, and when people ask me about the birth, I feel like I'm over explaining why it was necessary (as if I had any control over it). 

My husband takes over with the baby in the morning so that I can get some extra rest and when I finally get up makes a joke (""good morning sleeping beauty, how do you feel?"") and I snap on him.

I feel like I'm constantly over-justifying my parenting choices or snapping on people (primary my poor husband). But I can't stop. Logically, I know that these are all innocent remarks, I just feel like someone is constantly judging my every move. I haven't even brought up this part of how I'm feeling in therapy yet. Why?

TheoriginalGT,"Hi all, so glad I found this sub, and honestly, I don't know why it took me so long to search for it.

I have two children with a pretty decent age gap. My youngest is 10 months and I honestly feel like the depression started the moment I found out I was pregnant. 
I'm tired of feeling hollow. I had the intrusive thoughts and suicidal ideations shortly after my 6 wk PP appointment. Experienced a traumatic birth and would play it over and over in my head. I had mild PPD with my first and told my partner to help me recognize if I started slipping to make me get help.

I finally broke down a few months ago and started therapy. After my ""trial"" period ran out I didn't continue. It was kind of helpful but it required a lot of work on my part and as much as I wanted it I just didn't have the energy to commit. Big mistake. 

I've started feeling withdrawn and disconnected. I love my children so much and want to be the best I can be. 
How do I find the time to decompress? What are some coping methods that have worked for you?
I started reading again to try to unwind in the evenings. It seems like it helps a little but I know I need to find other outlets as well.

Miserable_Bug_16,"I was so grateful to be able to video chat with some of my friends yesterday. For a few of them, it was the first time they have ever seen my daughter (she's 4 months). We were talking like we used to and it made me so happy until they started getting all nostalgic and bring up things from middle school and early high school (I got pregnant at 17). I was smiling and laughing but I was dying inside. I don't think that they realize how much I miss doing things with them and with the pandemic and the baby I don't feel like I can anymore. 

After the call, I literally put my baby to bed and curled up in the corner, and cried myself to sleep. My fiancé found me there when she got home and I still haven't told her what happened. 

I miss just getting to be a kid. I miss being able to just randomly do things with my friends with no care in the world. I miss being able to talk about my emotions and not have anybody judge me for it. I can't count on both hands the number of times I've been shamed for feeling depressed. 

It's not that I don't love my baby, I do. I just feel like she'd be better off with a mother who doesn't feel terrible about every little thing. I tried joining another support group on Reddit but I had a horrible experience that made me feel even worse. Someone told me that I should just put my baby up for adoption and call it a day. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I have a therapist and she's wonderful and helps a lot but I feel like that only helps for a couple of days and then I'm stuck trying to get through the rest of the week. I tried meds but my doctor refused to put me on anything but Zoloft which at 50mg made things worse and then at 100mg made me sick and made things much worse. They're the only doctor in the area who has availabilities and takes my insurance so I'm stuck. 

Journaling and making posts to get things off my chest helps momentarily but then I feel terrible about making other people read about how shitty I feel and I delete the post.

I feel so alone and helpless. And it's not like I can reach out to anyone for immediate help because I don't have a phone and I can't find anything online that's free (I have literally no money). I feel so empty. The only emotions I feel anymore are anger, depression, and emptiness.

I feel like I have to fake everything at this point. I fake a smile. I fake a laugh. I fake being okay. I fake being happy. I feel terrible all. the. time.

Catzy94,"I had a therapist when I was an undergrad. Since I’m enrolled again, I set up appointments with her again. I’ve always had the policy of being honest with doctors. I smoke weed because it’s been the only thing that helps. I also breastfeed but I try to wait as long as possible between smoking and nursing. 24 hours minimum. Doctor reported me to CPS.

I live for my son. I read to him constantly. I’ve planned so much for his future. By every metric he’s not just healthy, he’s ahead of every milestone. The pediatrician is always impressed with how fast he’s growing and learning. His favorite thing is me reading to him.

I smoke to stay sane, to keep me from digging out the razor blades and hurting myself. I smoke so my son doesn’t have to see how miserable I am. It’s not his fault the chemicals in my brain refuse to work correctly.

I honestly don’t think me smoking is hurting him. He doesn’t show a single sign that it’s affected him. But maybe I’m wrong and I am a terrible mom for it. I just want to do what’s best for me. And apparently my doctor thinks what’s best for him is to not have me in his life. Maybe she’s right. And maybe I’m selfish for not wanting to live in a world where I’m not his mom anymore.

Rationally, I know that CPS probably doesn’t care and won’t do anything. I tested positive during my pregnancy when I was homeless and suicidal. The case worker told me multiple times they don’t care about weed. He told me he was angry because we’re good parents and investigating us is a waste of his time.

How do you tell someone you feel like you want to die? You feel like you want to self harm? But you don’t want them to worry? You don’t want them for feel burdened or responsible? You just want someone to know? I guess it’s just that old feeling of I don’t want to say anything because I don’t want to look like I’m seeking attention, but inside I’m screaming. And because I don’t know why I feel this way, because I don’t know what I need to hear or say, or do. I don’t really understand my own need to say it, especially when it seems to come with so many consequences.

I did try to talk to someone, and they seemed to understand a little but I didn’t want to push my luck and say no it’s more than that.

pregnantneeds,"Before I got pregnant I had anxiety and some depression. It was diagnosed as just “generalized” and most of it seemed related to work. 

Now I’m starting to feel the way I did again. I’m sad but I have no reason to be sad. I can’t shake the feeling or reason it away. I feel like I’m on the verge of crying all the time and I can’t seem to distract myself or even think of anything else.

Sometimes when it’s really bad I think I just want to die and then I feel guilty for that thought. I worry (unreasonably) that it will hurt the baby.

good_girl_bad_habit,"Tw:Miscarriage &amp; narcissistic abuse

I lost my baby July 2020...I miscarried silent &amp; alone in the bathroom in the middle of the night with my ex husband sleeping on the couch. Silent because he said we shouldn't tell the other kids and our middle son was home at the time. My ex knew  but couldn't be bothered to stay with me. The next morning on the way to hospital for the D&amp;C he yelled at me for not communicating well and listening when he asked if I could drive myself.

 I was told a few weeks latter that I had scored very high on post partum depression test. I started and therapy off and on but was focused on trying to keep going. I didnt take time off after I found out the baby had no heart beat or after the surgery since I started a high stress new job.  The ex person ended up taking another woman on vacation 5 days after I miscarried while I was struggling to pay bills. 


In the end, after the physical abuse, the emotional abuse the miscarriage and financial abuse I didnt break ties till December. I had believed pretty much everything he's said , the last of which that I couldn't do anything without him, I belonged to him and that I'm unstable but I'm finally getting help and trying to grieve my baby. 

What I'm concerned about now is that my period has been missing since December. I didnt notice till mid February due to moving and getting a restraining order. Last time we were intimate was November so it could be possible but PCOS makes my period stop for months then start non stop for months too. All the tests are negative but I swear sometimes I think I feel movement.

smarti4891,"Apologies, if this is not the correct forum to be asking this. One of my best friends is really struggling and is starting medication, has been going to therapy and opening up to me about her challenges. All things I fully support and I let her know that. I understand what depression can feel like, but I also understand that this is different (I have never had children, so I can’t fully relate but understand and empathize with her feelings). 

What are some ways I can support her that doesn’t come off as being too pushy? I try to check in with her via text, but not sure if asking how she is feeling/doing is ok to ask all the time, or if I share something that I’ve done would make her feel worse because she has been comparing herself to others a lot lately. I try to coordinate to see her in person and I am patient and understanding when she postpones or cancels last minute due to lack of sleep and depression. I tell her the visit doesn’t have to be perfect, and even if it’s just for a few minutes between feedings, I just want to check in on her and be supportive and see her and the baby. 

Her husband has been supportive and I know she struggles on week days when he is at work, so I have made an effort to see her during the week as I have some weekdays off. Is going over with food and helping out around the house too presumptuous? I feel like if I asked to do these things she would decline my offer, but I’m not sure about that. Don’t want her to feel shame or pity. Not my intention. I really just want to help. 

She has been open about how the depression is affecting her motivation to get out of the house and her sleep. But she has never mentioned any negative feelings towards the baby. So I’m assuming things are ok in that department. Or is there a chance and she just hasn’t expressed it?

Catzy94,"My kiddo is 3.5 months. I knew at 13 I wanted to be a mother. That desire to build a family caused me to jump in and out of abusive relationships. Thankfully, at (what I thought at the time was) rock bottom, I met my future wife (FW) We were both suffering through severe mental illness and became a support for each other. That led to our relationship and it’s been mostly good.

Unfortunately, the universe hates us. First, she had to go off hormones. After several years of HRT, that was a mess. She had horrible depression and dysphoria. I started going off the rails crazy. I would hallucinate and my normally well-controlled bipolar suddenly wasn’t. If you’ve ever played Medievil, picture the stained grass demon (first boss) but red and black instead of rainbow. That would randomly be staring back at me. We tried and tried.

(FW) changed her name and gender marker during this. All of a sudden our HOA was all over us with infractions. Yes, we were breaking the rules with a vehicle we owned. But they didn’t care until after she did the name and gender marker change.

We were low on funds, trying for a kid, and now being threatened with fines that could become a lien. Eventually we managed to sell the condo at a loss and buy our current place. Except the titles couldn’t be transferred that fast, so I was homeless for a week, during the pandemic, with everything we owned in a UHaul and no idea if we would be able to move in before losing everything.

The title office was sympathetic and we moved in. We couldn’t afford movers so at 6 months pregnant, I pulled muscles I didn’t know I had moving in. Which led to a UTI that caused a fever so bad I shivered like I was seizing and couldn’t get warm. EMTs came out. I was terrified that I was going to miscarry.

Then my ex wife popped back into my life and I got laid off. Had my son, but lost my unemployment because “I couldn’t work” while giving birth. Just one thing on top of another. And I’m in grad school.

Ppd hit hard after he was born. I wound up getting shitfaced four days after getting home with him. Oh, and CPS was called on me because I had weed in my system during the whole homeless thing because I was suicidal. The CPS guy was all kinds of cool but still not something I deserved to deal with.

Flash forward to now. I love my son. I love my partner. I have a new WFH gig and am interviewing for my dream job and getting my MA in May. Everything should be peachy now, right?

Im scared to seek help because I don’t want to be hospitalized and not see my son. My psychiatrist and my therapist will be out until June and May, respectively. The wait lists for an appointment are crazy long. I’m pretty good at managing myself but I’m so depressed I can’t function.

Having my son was like getting to the finish line of the hardest obstacle course I’ve ever run. And now I’ve made it, but I made it with, like, 1HP left. I have no mana to enjoy the happy ending. I need a real life Full Restore.

And every day I feel more and more like I’m a failure. Kiddo is taken care of, but I’m not present like I should be. And I’m not working as hard as I should be. I’m m scared I’ll lose my job because I suck at it right now.  I’m scared I’ll flunk out of my last semester. I’ve always been the person who couldn’t break because people needed me.

They pointed out my wife for not doing certain things which I used to do a little better than her . They had a huge argument around 2 weeks in which was kind of left behind now which she still thinks her parents are wrong . I agree with her on that . Around 3rd week one day our kid didn’t want to drink milk more than 10 minutes . She just had pooped and cried her lungs out . We do have tricks to wake her up and that day she wAsnt ready to get up after 10 minutes . So I suggested I don’t want to agitate her and let her sleep . That kind of ticked off my wife . She was like why do you act like you know it all . Just because you don’t want to tickle her legs and wake her doesn’t mean she isn’t hungry . That kind of carried on to the next feeding session where she was like you know how much to feed her  so tell me when to stop and I will stop .

deadhoe9,"I recently started an SSRI and it is making me so sick. The one I'm on now, escitalopram, is slightly better side effects wise than the zoloft I tried a few weeks ago. I'm nauseous and have an upset stomach, irritable, anxious, manic, can't sleep, have no appetite, gassy, and having horrible diarrhea which is compounded by my IBS. I have my daughter's two month check up tomorrow and I don't think I'll even be able to go with my husband to the appointment because I'm having to go to the bathroom every 15-20 minutes. I know moms are supposed to put everything aside for their babies, but I really don't want to shit myself on the way to the doctor's office or while I'm there. My parents are making me feel so guilty for either facetiming my husband during her appointment or for rescheduling it for when I'm not sick. They told me to just bring a spare change of pants and underwear or wear a diaper but shitting my pants and/or wearing a diaper like my fucking baby when I'm this emotionally vulnerable sounds beyond humiliating. I really should be able to tough it out for my baby though. Why can't I? Women have been doing this for centuries, why can't I?



I'm already hardly producing 4 oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period despite pumping or trying and failing to feed every 2-3 hours day and night. I'm exhausted. And now being this sick is lowering my already limited milk supply even more which is further stressing me out. I can hardly keep water down. I'm only continuing to pump so I can give my baby antibodies from my recent covid vaccine (first shot was 2 weeks ago, these definitely aren't side effects from the vaccine) or I'd just give up. Tonight I prepared an amazing dinner for my family and couldn't eat any of it because I felt so sick. Instead I hid in the bathroom and forced down a can of cold soup eaten directly from the can because I was so hungry that I was shaking which I promptly threw up thanks to the meds. My psychiatrist said to just tough it out because being sick at the start is normal and apparently feeling better in the long run is worth it. I literally can't be a parent right now. But I also could only parent slightly better without the meds because of my PPD/PPA so the meds are most likely worth the side effects I guess. I'm either in bed or on the toilet currently. All my baby wants to do is be held and walk around or else she screams and I feel too sick to do that. My husband is having to do everything, baby care, cleaning, and taking care of me, but I was so depressed he's not doing too much more than he already did. Maybe a few more chores and a few less breaks with the baby. I can hardly get out of bed or off the toilet enough to pump or fail at feeding her from my breast. Fuck covid, I wouldn't have to do this continuing to pump thing when I have no supply if people took it seriously at the start and if my husband and I hadn't started trying right before covid hit.

Thrway4AFriend352,"To start off I'm a man with very little experience in these areas. I'm attempting to make sense of the position my friend is in and what I can do to help. My friend, let's call him Adam, is married to Brie, and they currently have a 14 month old and Brie is also \~6 months pregnant. Adam works 70+ hours a week and Brie is a SAHM. For the last couple of years Brie would have these emotional outbursts, ripping into Adam for days at a time, demeaning him and then turning it around if he attempts to defend himself, saying things like how worthless she is and that Adam should just leave. 

Before her first pregnancy these episodes were few and far between, and she was always extremely apologetic after the fact. Starting with her first pregnancy things started becoming more intense and more frequent, which Adam attributed to pregnancy hormones. After the first child was born Brie's episodes again started getting more intense, which Adam attributed to PPD/PPA. Brie became pregnant and things stepped up another notch, this time with Adam attributing it the combination of PPD/PPA on top of pregnancy hormones.

While Adam works a lot, he's never been much of a sleeper, and frequently makes time to help Brie out with the baby. Brie's sister moved in a few months ago to help with the baby and other household chores (basically a part time nanny/housekeeper). Their baby seems low maintenance (for a baby, not in general) and surprisingly well behaved, sleeps through the night, doesn't have many crying fits. Even so, Brie's behavior continues to intensify. She'll often sleep all day, offload chores, and show disinterest in watching their baby. She'll constantly interrupt Adam while he's working and in meeting (WFH), becoming aggressive about things he did or didn't do. She belittles him and attacks his shortcomings or anything that might make him insecure - e.g., she'll mock him for his sexual performance (he's on antidepressants) and then suddenly switch to how ugly she must be. She also started digging through his messages to me and holding that against him. There have been a couple instances of her throwing expensive electronics across the room, breaking them, and even injured Adam's back when she slammed him against the wall to prevent him from leaving. Brie has told Adam he is not allowed to talk about anything that happens in the house to their friends and family (such as even that his back is injured). She'll leave the house with their baby and drive for hours while nonstop texting Adam about what a terrible person he is and that she's going to leave (I find this to be extremely reckless and dangerous).

Adam is at a loss as to what to do and is under the impression that he just needs to wait out the pregnancy hormones and PPD/PPA. However, Brie flat out refuses therapy, both at an individual level as well as couple's therapy. She also refuses to take medication (assuming it would be prescribed). I used to really like Brie but a lot of this behavior is upsetting. I don't feel like this behavior is simply going to resolve itself but this is all new territory for me and I'm concerned that this is likely just flat out abusive behavior.

I’ve been fighting it off since he was born 5 months ago but now I’m stuck. My house is a mess every where. I miss life before COVID. I feel like there’s more I can do and that I just haven’t done.

EmpatheticBarnacle,"I don't recommend watching this show while you have PPD/A. I'm a FTM, and my LO is almost five months old. I don't do much seeing as there's a pandemic and all, so LO and I just watch tv, play with his toys, watch the cat and dog, you know the usual. Well, I'm a late bloomer and decided I would start watching The Handmaid's Tale, after all I love Margaret Atwood. Nope. This show triggered the absolute crap out of me! I had been having really good days leading up to watching this show, my meds had kicked in and my therapist was really happy with my progress. While watching this show I was getting more and more anxious and depressed, I didn't associate it with the show right away. I thought I was slipping backwards, I figured I needed to contact my therapist and up my dose. I got into a fight with my husband, I mean I was hysterical and incredibly reactive to something so small. My husband told me to not watch the show for a day, he said just from the small moments he's walked in and heard the show it was upsetting to him. Boy, he was right! That show really fucked my head up. So if you haven't seen the show yet and you have PPD/A, I don't recommend watching it right now.

MochaMaker,"I'm seeing a doctor on Tuesday, that was the soonest they could see me, till then I hold on the best I can.

I delivered my baby on 2/1/21, she arrived 30+3 because I'd developed Preeclampsia-HELLP. When I got the magnesium drip, I got scared when I heard talk of strokes and seizures. At one point I told my husband that if something happened to me, I wouldn't blame him if he got remarried.. 
Baby was delivered vaginally and was whisked off the NICU immediately before I could even see her. I was in the hospital for a week because my blood pressure was regularly high and I felt overall sick including heart palpitations.

 My first night in the postpartum ward, I sat in my room alone  (my husband had to go home to check on our teen son) , I broke down and cried, when the nurse came to check on me, I sobbed and told her I was afraid that if I fell asleep I wouldn't wake up. The nurse left briefly and returned to gave me a benadryl, check my blood pressure and left me alone again. My husband had brought me a stuffed animal earlier which I clung to and sobbed on till the benadryl knocked me out. I went to sleep thinking my teen son wouldn't miss me if something happened to me.

On 2/5/21, I was able to go home, I cried on my husband's shoulder that I felt like a failure,  that'd I'd let our baby down,  he hugged me and assured me it wasn't my fault but here I am still feeling heavy with guilt. 
At 4 almost 5 weeks postpartum,  I felt extremely sick and knew something was off, my blood pressure was through the roof despite the medication I was taking. I went to the ER and was readmitted for postpartum preeclampsia, I was at the hospital for 3 days with another round of magnesium and then sent home again.
At my 6 week postpartum check up I told my doctor I'm still not feeling right. Since my baby was born I've been dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous, short of breath, and fatigued, overall I feel off. I cry everyday, I burst into tears and sob into my pillow at night. I cry when I get to my car after leaving the NICU. Tears stream down my face while I hold my baby and none of the NICU nurses are around. My doctor wasn't keen on prescribing medication and suggested vitamins such as vitamin D3, some probiotics,etc. 
I still feel ill daily regardless. 

2 days ago (8weeks postpartum)I went to the NICU to see my baby, not even 20 minutes there, my heart began racing despite the fact I was simply sitting quietly reading, I waited, but even after 15 minutes my heart rate went even faster, it felt like it was pounding against my chest, I got scared and sought help. One of the NICU nurses wheeled me downstairs to the ER department, but after 3 hours and a round of tests, they said nothing was wrong and sent me home.

Today, my husband and I went to the NICU together to see our baby. At one point the dizziness set in again, I was sitting back in the reclining chair provided while I held our baby close, we had just fed her and we had to keep her elevated as she has reflux. I tilted her slightly as I was caught off guard by the dizziness and she spit up a bit. My husband immediately scolded me for tilting her back causing the spit up. I began to cry, he then began to tell me there's no reason to cry, he asked me what was wrong which made me cry even more. We'd originally planned that I'd take maternity leave when baby came home and when my leave was done he'd take paternity leave but after this incident he said ""I think I should go on leave first if you're going to be like this"". 

I feel crushed, It's been nearly 2 months. I just want to feel better, I want to hold my baby. I'm so tired of driving to the hospital NICU everyday. I'm afraid to even go to the store alone because of the dizziness and palpitations. I keep telling my  doctors (GP, OBGYN, cardiologist)somethings wrong but even after countless blood tests and  appointments, they can't seem to find an answer. I cry because I'm scared, I fear I won't get to watch my daughter grow up.
Every time my husband asks me what's wrong I just cry,  I can't get the words out to describe what's wrong with me. I feel like a burden to him as he's left work early or called out countless times to help me. We can't afford it really.

 I just feel so broken and worthless right now. I'm praying the doctors can find an answer.",Postpartum_Depression,Struggling and scared vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mfjb7e/struggling_and_scared_vent/,1617024562.0,2021-03-29 06:29:22,1.5944417122977501e+19
djshaver21,"I spoke with my doctor of osteopath about my PPD/PPA. During his residency he noticed many women who had magnesium drips showed greater signs of PPD. 

I was diagnosed with PPD/PPA about a month before I gave birth. I then has severe preeclampsia, induced labor at 34 weeks, “labored/ pushed” for about 8-10 hours, CT scan to make sure I didn’t have a brain bleed, then ended up with an emergency c-section. We had to stay in the hospital for a week due to my blood pressure not stabilizing and daughter was in the NICU for 5 days. We had to stay in our room, due to Covid, they didn’t want us walking around. my husband couldn’t leave or else he wouldn’t be allowed back in for 24 hrs. And I couldn’t really walk due to all the swelling and blood pressure problems. I was pretty messed up physically for awhile, i still get numb hands, carpal tunnel the obgyn said would go away after giving birth, it’s been 9months and it still comes and goes. Much better than before tho. it was all pretty traumatic for me.  Sorry for the rant birth story. But I also think the birthing experience increases our PPD/PPA. No one EVER talked to me about how traumatic giving birth really is. All the women in my life looked great when they came home and had everything together it seemed. Tired yes but never traumatized. 

Getting to my question here...

Maybe mag drip made PPD/PPA even worse, I will never know. but I was wondering how many other women had mag drips and then suffered from PPD/PPA?",Postpartum_Depression,Mag drip?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/mexjyx/mag_drip/,1616945801.0,2021-03-28 08:36:41,2.4859525898449265e+18
BoomBunnie,"I've tried every game, every activity, every everything it feels like.... for him to tell me ""you just need this,"" and as much as I love him. I just can't, its so hard to look at him through this lense of understanding when they just don't get it. They don't get the disappointment at not measuring up to the expectations of what I am as a mother. The ADHD, the possible ASD, the everything I was with my first child, is just NOT ABLE to be there anymore. And it doesn't matter. I need to equal up. I need to be there. I need to be that person I can't be anymore. They hate me for it. Listen to me...when I say that's not me anymore and please love me anyway. I guess its not super possible...but I just don't feel loveable. I don't feel sexy. I don't feel like I'm me. To anyone. Including my children. I feel worthless. I just want to jump out that window and not look back. How many people stop themselves from going through with this just because they don't want their children to live through the trauma they did. I can't. I just don't know how. I can't anymore. No amount of therapy I have that tells me about the things I have, explains the things I have, but gives no comfort or help. I'm just alone.

Our son is up from 10pm-4am, I can’t sleep during the day with him because something in my body just won’t let me sleep when he does and it’s really effecting me. I got upset when SO said he’s gonna go to the gym and that I could go with him on his days off but how?? We have a 3 week old. I feel like I don’t have a life anymore. He is my life.

D3viantcrew,"It’s been about 5 months since my wife gave birth to our beautiful baby boy. I’m so happy being a dad and feel so blessed for him but our marriage is pretty much over and it’s only been 5 months. It makes zero sense and on paper we shouldn’t be having issues. Our baby is easy compared to other babies I hear about he’s been sleeping in his own room and through the night since month 3 so it’s been over two months of us getting good sleep and on top of that he’s not really a crazy fussy baby or hard to feed honestly I feel like we hit the baby lottery he’s such an easy baby to care for. I’m the only one who works my wife wanted to be a stay at home mom and thankfully I make enough for us to afford this and not have money issues. We don’t fight about money. Honestly idk why we fight or argue or why we are at this point but I’m so lost, I’ve said we should go to marriage counseling or therapy and that maybe she should see a doctor as to why she seems so aggressive towards me, and it’s only me. She’s a great mother, I try and show appreciation and try and give her space she travels to Jacksonville to see her mom a lot since where we live now she feels alone and says she has no one. I get where she’s coming from but I can’t deal with being treated like this anymore. It’s not physical or anything like that but she’s emotionally disconnected from me. She dosnt respect me, when she’s angry she says such hateful things to me and idk if she really means it. Right now she’s gone for a week which to be honest I’m happy for because I needed a break from her but I miss my son so much. I work 60+ hours and I feel like I never see him all I want to do is spend time with him as a family and he’ll be gone this whole week so I can’t even see him for the hour or two I see him before bed everyday. What’s worse is now my wife is getting even worse. It’s one thing for us to get divorced, I can handle that what’s more important is for us to be civil with each other and be great coparents because I want my child to have a healthy relationship with both of us. This weekend I went to Jacksonville and wanted to have our son just for a few hours Sunday to take him to see my parents since they rarely see him since my wife has been like this but she suddenly raged for like 3 seconds when I said can I take him with me, at first she said she already made breakfast plans with a friends and I said that’s fine I can take him after your plans, then she said no after she had more plans to hang with her mother to go shopping and more and I said well that’s fine but you don’t need him to go shopping and have fun with your mom let me take him it’ll give you a break and also let me have time to see him and my parents. She suddenly raged saying “NO I WANT HIM WITH ME” and I just sat there shocked. She’s never been that way withholding our child from me. I let it go for a couple of hours and brought it up again and mentioned she can’t keep our child from me like that I just wanted to visit my parents for a few hours I mean she’s going to be there this whole week and couldn’t give me 3 hours.  Sunday came and she ignored my texts didn’t respond to me and kept my child from me and I had to drive back home since I had work the next day. It’s getting too toxic and now she’s keeping my own child from me. Enough is enough but idk what to do. My life consists of work and coming home and that’s it, I’m perfectly fine with my life as long as I’m coming home to my family and not treated like I’m a monster.

I'm genuinely struggling with the bond between my 11 month old son and I.  I'm 4 months pregnant.. it all started with morning sickness making me hate his natural smell, it made me so sick.. then the irritation kicked in, his loudness was to much, then breastfeeding aversions started making me feel crazy and full of anger, I kept snapping at him over biting and everything else, he's refusing the boob now because I have ruined his comfort that he found in me.  I am struggling constantly watching him bond with his father and hardly want anything to do with me.   It was never like this until I got pregnant again.  I am resenting this pregnancy to the point that I don't want it. I just want my son. I miss my son and the bond we shared and all the moments I unintentionally ruined that I'll never get back.

Top_Interaction8871,"Advice needed.

My brother and sister in law had their first son (OS) 3.5 years ago and second son (YS) 2 years ago.  Since then, my SIL has been a stay at home mum.  

My SIL is a good mum, but since OS was born some of her behaviour has odd and sometimes obsessive.  **We think SIL has PPD but we dont know what to do to offer help. And we are worried about my brother who is at exhausted physically, and emotionally.**

My brother is beside himself and not sure what to do - we are all super worried about all of them.   My brother wakes up, tends both kids, makes them breakfast, prepares their lunch, then goes to work for 8 hours, comes home to cook dinner, clean the house and put boys to bed. My brother is exhausted and desperate for a break.

**So i need some advice on how we can support both of them.**  My suggestion to my brother is that he talks to his doctor and raises his concern, or goes with SIL to doctor and shares his concerns with both to see what help both he and SIL can get.   And if this does not work (as he suspects that SIL will just double down that nothing is wrong), that he talks to SIL's parents thats he is concerned about SIL and why and ask them for support (but he's worried that not only will SIL double down, she will leave and/or isolate herself further).

Some examples of SILs behaviour.

 \- Talks about wanting to keep both boys babies as long as possible.  Wont go back to work, as this would be ""leaving them"".

 \- Any suggestion or feedback about either son, from brother, doctor, health nurse, kindergarten teacher, is taken as a criticism of my SIL as a mother.   For example, the kindergarten gives parents feedback on their children, this is just normal feedback on behaviour, colouring skills, etc.  My SIL took their feedback on OS as a direct criticism of her as a ""mother"". 

 \- Except for the 2 nights in hospital when having YS and now 1 hour a week when OS goes to Kindergarten, my SIL has NEVER been apart from her sons.   Not for coffee, not for catchup with friends or even date night with her partner (my brother).  

 \- Both boys are not allowed to play outside, they are kept in a 3x5m lounge room from the moment they wake to the time they go to bed; unless my brother forces SIL to take them to the park on the weekend.  When they do get taken outside by SIL, they are in the pram and stays there until they arrive home. 

 \- SIL uses TV as ways for the boys to engage, and as baby sitter, if she needs a quiet moment, e.g. for OS when she is tending YS, etc.

 \- SiL prefers the immediate family bubble, e.g. SIL, Brother, 2 Sons.  Prefers family not to visit.  Gets overly emotional and angry if people want to visit. Visits have to be scheduled weeks/months in advance. This includes her family and my brothers family. 

 \- SIL will rarely allow the boys to be alone with my brother, their father, as they are HER boys and have to stay with HER.  So even when brother tries to take boys to park to give SIL a break, this will cause a large argument about the boys being taken away from her.

 \- The boys are constantly bored as their world is limited; when they do get taken to the park, they are desparate to engage with any other child and become desparate to stay when being made to leave it.",Postpartum_Depression,Help with Sister in Law with PPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/m4ql92/help_with_sister_in_law_with_ppd/,1615732225.0,2021-03-14 07:30:25,2.0914037821612283e+18

Docwifearchivistlife,"So I (FTM, 27) have a 5-week-old baby boy, Anthony. Yesterday I was diagnosed with PPD and my doctor is fairly certain I'm oxytocin deficient, based on a number of factors. I've been on Prozac for years, and we added Lyrica back onto my regimen (I stopped taking it when I got pregnant).

I feel like I can't connect to my son, like we're not bonded as we should be. It doesn't help that I cannot breastfeed. It doesn't hurt me or upset me when he cries, and I know that biologically it's supposed to. My mom heard him crying over the phone and said it was breaking her heart, whereas for me I was just meh (I was driving and couldn't do anything about his crying; I wasn't just letting him cry). I never feel like I want to smile or talk to him, it just feels weird and almost unnatural. I sing to him and read books, but that's it. Sometimes it just doesn't feel like he's my baby. Don't get me wrong, I love him, but it feels more as if he's a nephew of mine than my own flesh and blood. The super strong maternal bond just isn't there and I hate it.

My husband, on the other hand, is obsessed with our son, to a level I wish I could be. He's always saying to me, ""wife, I love this little boy so much. I just can't stop cuddling/kissing/looking at him."" And then it makes me feel ashamed that I don't always feel the same way. I love cuddling with him and he is so freaking adorable, but idk. It feels like he loves our son more than I do, and it's not supposed to be this way.

Obviously I don't want DH to stop showing affection to our son, but I almost wish he wouldn't do it in front of me, because it makes me feel so bad. Idk how I could ever ask him to do that. I just hope the Lyrica will help me feel better, and I hope I can find ways to bond better with Anthony.

He is the best thing to happen to my husband and I, and that’s why I feel so guilty for being so sad and angry all the time.

LaBelleGiselle,"Hello ladies!
I am a STM, student, and need your help!

I have a 4-year-old girl that is on the spectrum and am currently 39 weeks pregnant with my second child. Ever since I can remember I have heard people say that every pregnancy is different. From my personal experiences, they seem to be right!

I had a very difficult first pregnancy, but I wanted to become a mother more than anything. After almost losing my child at 12 weeks I began to feel defeated, but that feeling lasted months after I gave birth. I never spoke to anyone about my postpartum depression, (PPD), but it almost made me feel detached from the child I fought so hard for.
Now, at 39 weeks, I can say I have been blessed with a very “easy” pregnancy (although I haven’t given birth yet, so we’ll see!) and it’s difficult to know if my PPD will come back.

These experiences prompted my study in pathology behavior, more specifically, postpartum depression (PPD). My group and I have developed a short survey that can help us with our research. If anyone is willing to take it please follow the link:

K_saudade,"Her parents don’t believe in depression or most mental health issues.  I just want to help her, but have no idea how...any advice is helpful and appreciated.

She has sever detachment from her second baby and I’m trying to help over the phone...  She refuses to go to therapy and has threatened to hurt her children on multiple occasions.  She and my son live with her parents a few states away...and no one seems to understand the pain she is in.

I have heard most of this secondhand, except for the detachment she feels towards her youngest (not 2 months old).  I don’t think she would ever harm her children, but I am still concerned.  Her pain is lashing out to everyone in her family (that she is living with). 

I’ve tried connecting and advising that she should seek therapy, but to be selective with therapists that specialize in this.  She agreed to go, I made myself a safe place to vent to...but it has blown up with her family.

It’s going ok I’m still not entirely sure what I’m doing? Or well I’ve lost my freedom entirely but I still love my son to bits? An entire responsibility now sits upon my shoulder and I worry every other second if the little fella is doing ok? 

Motherhood just like how it treated you is treating me the same way too. Everyday I learn something new. There are some days that are easy and there are others where I just want to lock myself up in the room and cry. It is a challenge that I was not prepared for no matter how many books I had read before the baby came along. There are days where I feel like a complete failure of a mum and there’s nothing I can do but move on and hope I do better tomorrow. Thank you for your question but no I do not wish to tell you how motherhood is treating me.

I get absolutely no help. I live with her dad and he never comes home after work. He’s either playing games with his friends or getting coked out.

Sparky-G97,"I don't know how to share my thoughts without feeling like I'm sounding annoying and asking too much for someone to listen, even to all you strangers I'm struggling to write this. 

Since the birth of my second child my mental state continually deteriorates. I did counseling, did the mood stabilizers, proper diet and exercise, SAHM, then tried full time working mom, change of place, change of friends, changed everything I could to not feel this anymore. With every new stone turned not producing results it gets a little worse. I had to cut my biological family out of my life due to a traumatic childhood and for the safety of my children. My friend group slowly fizzled out until there was no one left. Now I spend so much of my day trying and failing to dissociate enough to seem happy that everyone can see how unhappy I really am. This is taking a toll on my husband, he blames himself so much that I am terrified to tell him how empty I feel. I don't want him to internalize this. How do you cope with knowing every birthday of yours you'll get no calls, no visits, no cake. How do I come to terms with living for myself when I feel I have nothing to live for. My kids deserve far better than what I can ever offer them. I've dragged my husband down with me into this darkness. Outside of that I have not a single soul that wants to spend any time with me. Before I filled my time with hobbies and small joys, but despite loving my paintings, loving the food I make, loving the long drives, and especially the karaoke nights, no matter how hard I try I cannot love myself or love being alive. I'm so so tired. I hate loneliness above all else yet I'm lonely all of the time. I know my kids and my love need me and want me here with them always. It just hurts so so much being here fearing another 60-80 years of feeling this. 

I don't know what to do, I just want to be happy.

seekingclarity88,"So I’m about 2 mos PP. To backtrack, I had an overall pretty stressful third trimester as my existing high blood pressure all of a sudden became uncontrolled even w meds and I dually got diagnosed with gest diabetes at the same time. To top that off, they discovered a large cyst on my ovary. The BP was concerning enough that I got put on disability from work to be on home bedrest at 27 weeks...My 35-36th week was admitted to the hospital for hospital bedrest and finally delivered at 36 and 4 days. With all the checkups and drs I absolutely hated it, and it caused me so much shame that I couldn’t enjoy a “regular” 3rd trimester but I had a glimmer of hope as once this baby is delivered healthy, my pregnancy related health issues would go away as well.

Except my health issues didn’t go away. Cyst still there, probably needing to have surgery for removal. Blood pressure still high and uncontrolled. Diabetes officially diagnosed (just got my lab results today). PPD and PPA since delivering...The health issues seem endless...and so overwhelming. Top that off with just being a new mom in general and learning everything for the first time as I go. I’m due to go back to work in a couple weeks and need to start back full time for the benefits and money. I asked my husband to stay home w the baby bc we can’t afford daycare and his job makes significantly less than mine...we wouldn’t be able to survive on his paycheck alone. He’s feeling overwhelmed being a first time dad too. 

So between the horrible physical health, mental health, financial stress, marital stress, and a new baby I just feel like I’m drowning.

My life feels so chaotic and it feels like I’m being demanded to get it fixed and structured or else there will be so many worse consequences to come. 

I just needed to vent and maybe ask for positive words of encouragement/advice...I have a good support system of people who love and care for me but I find myself being ashamed to talk to them about my issues.

taystee23," I had my first baby in October, a beautiful boy. He ended up having a lot of neurological problems because they said he had a stroke in utero. He lived his whole life in the hospital, because the doctors told me I had to make a decision to let him live a horrible quality of life. Or let him die peacefully.

  The only way he would have been able to go home with me was if he had multiple invasive surgeries to live outside of the hospital. A tracheotomy and a feeding tube in his stomach. He had severe severe brain damage. He wouldn't be able to eat without a tube or breathe without a ventilator. He would never be able to walk, talk, or sit up on his own. So I made the decision to take him off life support, thinking I was being the best mom I could to him. He was 3 months and 5 days old and so beautiful. He looked completely normal. 

 Ever since I had him, even before we took him off support I have suffered the worst depression and anxiety I've ever had in my life. I have nightmares and night terrors. I'm really just rambling here bc I have no one else to talk to about this but complete strangers. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, and just when I think I have no more tears to cry...they keep coming. I just feel so traumatized like I will never get past this.

I tired to nurse my baby, I started feeling really hot, overwhelmed, sore, sad and disappointed with myself. The baby wasn't latching. then baby was crying and so was I! I was feeling like maybe I should've died during delivery I didn't feel like my baby loved me. I handed my little one to my husband so I could cry. In hopes it would get better it didn't. I had no clue that I would be dealing with PPD! I didn't even know it was a thing! when my doctor (new) I might add asked how I was doing after birth or if there had been anything life changing. I told her yes. I keep feeling overwhelmed and sad, plus two day after coming home I lost a favorite family member of mine to cancer in which I didn't know they were sick. She did nothing to help. she said ""sorry to hear that"" no lets see how we can help with it! I tell myself to this day if she had listened to me really heard the pain I could have been helped instead of feeling the way I did for so long. Sad, mean and angry! I will be honest I was horrible to my husband during that time but I also had moments where I did feel human. enough in fact no to long after we created another human. which lead to moire hormones, more anger, more sadness. I thought the whole time I was just crazy, a horrible person. I didn't think or look at as pregnancy hormones or PPD. I said the most hurtful things to him. that I didn't mean. it was like watching a movie play out and you can't tell the main character to SHUT UP!! I as the main character. After some huge fight I would have to sit alone to gather myself and think back to what I said to him. a lot of the time I was in shock at what I remembered saying. Most times he would have to remind me what I said. during my second pregnancy we found out I had a severe blood disorder that could affect the baby. we had to do so much blood work, two doctors visits a week. it was stressful. pregnancy, stress, a little one under one and hormones. You guessed it it made me even more of villain. I was home sad, alone, pregnant, with a toddler and just sad that I had to do alone while my husband was at work. No matter how hard I tired to be nice it was like a little demon who kept taking over what I wanted to say. I never wanted to hurt him ever. Because he is truly the first person in my life who haas shown me love! I knew from the moment I met him that I wanted to be his friend. that we would be best fiends. we connected so strongly! when he finally told me how he had feeling for me I was so happy because I like him too! from the moment we started dated we were together like glue. so the fact that I hurt him, said the thing I said, did the thing I did I feel awful everyday. Once our second baby arrived I thought I would be better. Boy was I wrong. it was a struggle living where we were. getting put down everyday by people who are supposed to love and support you. taking care of a one year old and new born all while trying to keep yourself together. I had so many days where I would tell myself to be happy! you love your kids, you love your husband and you fought to be here for them so why can't you just be NORMAL! I would tell myself to snap out of it your alive. why are you sad. But all I could see and feel about myself was unworthy, useless, helpless and just a gross body! which made me even more of villain to my husband. I was mad at him for saying I looked good because to myself I looked like a piece of crap. my stomach was pale and weird. my boobs where Huge with milk dripping out. I wish I could have taken him compliments but I couldn't something inside was telling me otherwise. that I was just some horrible ugly person. I tried losing the weight I gained but that 15 wouldn't go anywhere. I tired hard but nursing, being with a toddler I started to lose the focus to go work out, to eat health. I started snacking and grabbing what I could when I could. our living situation was still horrible so of course already feeling like shit about yourself and then having family telling you you're fat and lazy doesn't help. it didn't help me at all it made me cry  more, hate myself more and you guessed it made me take it out on my husband more. Things I would normally wouldn't get upset about you bet I was crying and texting him about it. I made him feel bad because I was felling down about myself. I had no one to turn to I wish I could've turned to him and told him how I was feeling but instead I would get anger at him. which was far. we never felt at home there. there was constant insults, yelling and people in the way. he feels like I never took his side but boy is he wrong. I would get into a huge rawr about how we didn't feel welcomed there. people would eat or food, wake or kids up. in the mist of all that we lost our privacy. I didn't feel like I could kiss him in the open, huge him, say I love you because of the remark I would get. we had to basically only be married in our room. I felt like we were teenagers living with them. fast forward you probably guessed it we were pregnant again. when had the same health scare as our second. a lot of doctors visits a lot of sadness but this time. he had a job that kept him a lot of long hours which meant I missed him allot more, which made me mad because I didn't get to see him as much. we had a lot of family trips which helped because it was the only way we could be alone just the four of and when the kids went to bed just the two of us. you also probably guessed it I wasn't nice this time around either! why you may ask well to be honest I don't know wanted to show how much I loved, respected and cared for him but something in me wouldn't let me. my love came off as joke or being mean and this isn't how I wanted them to. I prayed a lot after everyone went to sleep wherever I could a lot of the time it was in the tub. I would pray to go please help me get better! please help me be a better wife to my husband. I would also ask him, why did you help me come back if I was going to be this way. this isn't the wife I wanted to be in my head. I didn't know who this person was. it was consist black out after black in arguments. a lot of which I still don't remember. I have always hoped that my husband could forgive me because one day I would get better and be there for him the way I had always wanted to be. the new baby arrived one of my best deliveries! no complications everything went smooth. until it wasn't. I started getting the hot, overwhelmed, I hate myself and why do I look like this moment. the nothing I do is right feeling. the I just can't pull it together feel. I tried my best to be as aware as I could be honestly I don't remember much. fast forward to two years later still the same. thing I want to show him love it won't come out in the way I want it to. just jokes which he didn't take as love. finally I realized I really need help but then Im sacred if I reach out to someone they will think I'm crazy and take my kids away. I can do it on my own. almost a year later after struggling to get it together. we moved into out own place, I have been able to look at myself in the mirror with clothes on and off. I started to be able to show my husband love. I was able to get out off bed without being a reck that I would hear negative comments all day. I was able to play music and just love life. don't get me wrong I had moments where I would text him to complain but never because I wasn't happy. he was just my only friend. now he want a divorce and I don't. I'm finally a happy me, positive not angry a person I feel like he could really love. I feel so bad and hurt because so much bad has happened but we have also had so much good. I feel like now that I'm finally good we could try to get back to the us before PPD. I know he has a lot of hurt from the things that has happened because I have so much guilt. I just hope we are able to air it all out. oh I forgot to mention that over all those years we never talked out any of our fights. we would yell and yell it would go no where. then we would move on. unhealthy yup I know. which is why I'm happy he said he would do couple therapy with me. he said he still wants a divorce and I just want to be able to help him let go of all the resentment he holds against me and he can see now that I'm no longer that PPD angry person.",Postpartum_Depression,No Clue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/lmfrvu/no_clue/,1613654681.0,2021-02-18 06:24:41,1.2456433502437843e+19

I'm in no way against medication but if it's simply sleep dep I don't think adding chemicals will help, especially since the side effects cause things like fatigue and apathy.....I already have enough of that! Can sleep deprivation mimic depression?  Or could it be hormones? My cycle has not returned as he nurses all night long.

Schwebbers,"
I am a psychologist with a 5 month old son, and I am so sick of hearing all these Hollywood-myths about love and attachment that I believe are really unhealthy and create a lot of pressure for new parents, so please read this if you are a new parent struggling:

If you do not feel overwhelming love for your new born and/or if you did not feel euphoria at birth you are perfectly NORMAL / it is estimated that around 60% (!) do NOT feel overwhelming love and/or euphoria when they have a child and that is JUST FINE! You do NOT (nessecarily) have PDD if you feel like this - you have PDD if you have a depression! Actually - some people with PDD do feel quite a strong connection with their children, so PDD is about being depressed, not about the amount of love you feel! Let me tell you why there is absolutely nothing wrong with you for not feeling a lot of rainbows-unicorns etc: Attachment is a process like getting to know everyone else is a process. A lot of evolutionary studies suggest that we find babies most adorable from 6 months onward, probably because this is the time we began being quite sure they would survive on the savanna / in our cave / wherever our ancestors had babies. So being overly attached early on has simply not been evolutionarily beneficial - it is estimated that around 20% of all babies in prehistoric times would not make it passed the first 6 months of life, so it is really smart for us humans to attach slowly - securing our own mental well being when babies did not survive, or factoring the older children who we were already attached to and who had better survival chances if resources were limited. So please please please do not beat yourself up if all you are feeling is responsibility toward your newborn - because your feeling of responsibility is everything that baby needs to survive! Your bond will form over many months and years just like any other close bond. You are doing everything you need to be doing and you are doing GOOD ENOUGH!

And one last thing: The only time I ever feel overwhelming love for anyone is when the people I really, truly care about are very sick or in crisis. You are NOT supposed to feel overwhelming love for your children all the time (that sounds incredibly exhausting) - the strong feelings of love will pop up now and then and then go away again, just like every other feeling. What is important is that you continuously feel the need to take care of them and keep them safe. You bond will develop, you will feel love from time to time and you are NORMAL and you are ROCKING at parenting &lt;3

That’s all!",Postpartum_Depression,If you are a new parent please read this about love and attachment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/lhhbc5/if_you_are_a_new_parent_please_read_this_about/,1613061627.0,2021-02-11 09:40:27,1.2642590433738981e+19

Ur_a_wizard_Barry,"So... DD is 6 months old this month. My PPA/PPD has seemingly tapered off, though I still have bad days. I guess this is a question to any other moms who struggled/are still struggling and thinking about baby #2. 

My PPA was severe. Wasn’t sleeping, barely eating. I lost 30lbs in 8 weeks. Was in therapy. On medication. And swearing to everyone around me that I would never do this again. I love my daughter more than life itself, but I swore I wouldn’t put myself, my husband or another child through the 4-5 months of hell we all endured. But now... I am feeling immense guilt/embarrassment/anxiety over my feelings of wanting another baby. Not necessarily right now, but in the next few years. The guilt and embarrassment comes from my husband almost getting a vasectomy (yes that’s how serious we were about not doing this again) and from also telling anyone who asked that I would never do it again. I know at the end of the day who cares? But unfortunately I am one of those people who lives in a constant state of anxiety over what people around me say/think about me. And how will they respond and laugh when, “she said she would never have another child and look what happened.”

I journaled throughout my post-partum period to remind myself of how scary my thoughts were and how physically/mentally not there I was. And I go back and read my entries and cry because I don’t even recognize the shell of a person I was 3 months ago. And now I want to willingly do this again? I’m just really struggling with this mentally.

He was practicing making funny faces and I was making funny faces too and talking to him. Before this I always laugh a lot and it was fun. But today was different. As he was making faces on me I suddenly got terrified. Of my beautiful baby boy. Suddenly his usually funny and sweet face seemed so intense and.... terrifying. I'm so ashamed to admit this. I needed to turn my head away from him and put him down in his nest, where I put him to get his food or other stuff. At first I tried to laugh it off, but then it happened again. I can't even describe what I got so terrified of. I read a few stories like this, but they were all specific thing - feeling trapped by the baby, afraid of losing him, afraid of doing something wrong. That's not my case. I was scared of him, as of his being.

I don't know what to do. I'm ashamed for feeling this way and I feel like my mind is just spiraling out of control. Does anyone have experience with something similar or I'm really going absolutely psychotic? Could it be the lack of sleep and food? Please help!",Postpartum_Depression,Please help!

korr919,"Apologies in advance for this rant! 

Let me say like everyone else, I am going through postpartum depression, my son will be 11 months old on Saturday, so I know I am acting a little crazy. But I can't help it.

So the issue is with my husband's dad and step mom. My father in law is a good guy, but he needs to learn boundaries. Him and my husband work together and he constantly calls my husband and also shows up at our house unannounced almost every weekend. (They are both mechanics and we have a shop and my father in law conveniently has side work at our house allllll the time). So needless to say I am so incredibly frustrated with him I am having a hard time reminding myself he's actually a good guy. 

The main issue though is with his bitch of a wife. My husband and I have been together for 13 years and the whole time she has been a miserable selfish bitch. Then when I got pregnant she literally said ""well I guess since there is a baby coming I better start being nice"". So she obviously knows she's a bitch. Now that my son is here all she does is complain about how she doesn't get to see him enough. I finally had to set a boundary of every other weekend for 3 hours, because for a while it was every weekend them calling about seeing the baby and leaving him longer and I'm just not willing to give up that much time with my son. I work all week and only get 2 hours a day with him on a work day, so my weekends are my time with him and I am very selfish with my time with him. I don't want him to grow up and look back and wish I would have been able to spend more time with him especially through his infancy, he changes minute to minute, I don't want to miss anything. 

I don't want him around her, i don't want her to influence him in anyway shape or form. She is a miserable human being who's only concern is herself. She only wants to be around my son because he's needy and it makes her feel needed, she made a comment one time about only wanting to take him on a walk in a stroller that has him facing her so he can look at her. Who TF says shit like that? She threw a fit one time because we didn't send him with any baby food and ""we are being selfish and keeping all the fun stuff for ourselves"". Meanwhile I'm pretty sure she is feeding him food without our permission I just don't have any proof so I'm not 100%.

Anyway, the jist of it is whenever we drop our son off, I have so much anxiety I feel like I can't breathe sometimes.  However I can't restrict how often she sees him anymore then I have. Just looking to see if I'm alone or not. I know a lot of people have issues with in-laws so I guess I'm also just wondering how you guys have gotten through it.

Idk where to else to put this and I have no one else to vent to. I had a baby on Oct 26, 2020 via c-section. It wasn’t the best experience honestly because my pain medicine wore off during my surgery. Anyway now I’m here 3 months later and I feel down everyday. Every second of my day goes to the baby. I never get any time to myself, showers and meals are luxuries at this point. I cry often, I’m either irritated, sad, or incredibly angry. The ONLY person I have patience for is my child but I’m starting to resent my husband and this life that I’m living now mostly because I told him so many times how much I didn’t want a kid yet, I’m only 22 and I haven’t lived life yet but we got pregnant anyway and Now I’m stuck in a house 24/7 with a screaming small human and I MISS ME!!! Idk who I am anymore other than a lady who wears throw up most of the day. My fiancé still gets to be himself, still gets to leave and do his hobbies and all I have is the baby. I have no sense of self it’s just baby baby baby all the time. I miss me! I miss how I looked I hate my body. I’m so insecure that I actively avoid and cover up mirrors and it feels like no one understands. No one calls and ask about me they only want to see the baby n if I try to talk about me they brush me off and talk about the baby. The baby is fine, IM NOT!! Some days I just wanna get my things kiss my baby and leave and I hate myself for feeling that way but damn I just miss me so much. I miss being able to shit in private and peace. I feel like I died on that OR table and another version of myself was born when my baby was born and I have no idea who that person is.

kinchous,"My labor took me about 24 hours and the contractions was one of the most painful things I've ever experienced in my life. I didn't expect that the post partum contractions would just be as painful. I knew I was going to bleed, I knew it was going to hurt, I knew it was going to be painful, but I think I was too naive to know that the uterus still kicks your ass as she tries to return to her original size.

I'm worried about this pain, how long will I feel crippled, how long will it be until I can walk without holding on to the wall or anything I can find. There's so many things I need to do around the house for the baby so just being immobile is giving me severe anxiety. Also all the pumping I need to prepare for my baby and just my baby in general. 

I'm not sure if I have PPD but this morning in the hospital I felt a severe emptiness. I looked at my baby that I love but I felt so empty. I'm not sure why? I guess it's probably hormones but it was such a weird feeling. Almost like someone reminding me that I've checked this of my list in life .... So what's next? I almost felt robotic. What a strange feeling that I'm not sure where it even came from when there's so much to look forward to. Maybe it's also fear of being a new parent and doing things right, whatever that may be? Maybe I'm scared from all the responsibility that is now on my shoulders... Maybe I'm scared I'll be a bad parent because I really don't know what to do as this is my first child.

I know I should be happy.. considering my boyfriend has a history of cancer and was told he would never be able to have kids.. it took a year for us to conceive our son. So 1 time for this pregnancy is incredible.   If it wasn't meant to be happening then it wouldn't come so easily.. I know that.  

I am really hating myself for feeling so down about this pregnancy. 

What is wrong with me? What kind of mother am I? What kind of mother doesn't get excited about her pregnancy? I'm really beating myself up over this.

misstulip97,"Ive EBF my baby since hes been born so that made my period stop amd eventually come back 10 months postpartum. Since then Ive had the absolute worst anxiety amd depression.

Tight-Living-5739,"First off this is gonna probably be pretty long but im about to go crazy if I dont vent in some shape or form. I have to start this off by saying. (because this will be important later) That I was molested A LOT by several different family members and have gotten older (20) and realized there were alot of adults who were doing inappropriate things that I just didnt register as a child. So to start this off when I was 6 I moved from South Carolina to Tennessee because my mother got locked up and my grandmother didnt want my father to keep us (with good reason) . I also believe but have not got clarification that we left due to the 1 molestation incident that my family actually knows about . i have scars to this day from me ripping in my private areas . it was one of the worst. after moving to Tennessee I had a rough time here because for one im in a really blantly racist town and im in a area I am not familiar with. I did not get along with my mother even one bit and my father was not involved in my life by his choice . I did not and do not speak to any of my family members due to the molestation by my cousins. When I turned 18 I left for college which was a good 3 hours away from anyone I knew and given my relationship with my family it didnt seem like a big deal but more like a relief from toxicity. Shortly after moving I ended up having to pick up a extra job while also going to school . I was constantly exhausted but couldnt get rest because I had to pay bills. I ended up meeting a man at work , 39 years old that offered to essentially pay my bills and buy me food for company . and thats exactly how it started for a while. he bought me food , clothes , took me shopping , bought me a range rover etc and then one day I got drunk with him. I thought I could trust him but when I woke up I could tell I had been violated sexually. I tried to play it off cool and let him leave but I went in the bathroom and cried . I decided I wasnt gonna talk to him until a few weeks later when I came to find out I was pregnant. so I had to come up with a new plan. I decided I would try and finesse the situation by using the pregnancy as a way to get him to buy me a new apartment, furnish it , and give me some extra money and just get a abortion and cut him off . My lease ended in a month and I felt like that was the perfect opportunity. he agreed to get me these things and everything was as good as it was gonna get given the circumstances. I started to pack my things the first friday of may I believe , unfortunately I took too long and we werent gonna be able to make it to sign the lease that day so he told me he rescheduled for me to go and sign on monday and that we would just get a hotel until then. After ive gotten all my things into the car we drive to a hotel , everythings calm. we dont have sex , we just eat and talk. when monday comes he drives to nashville and pulls up to centennial park and parks. he then proceeds to tell me that he has been homeless this entire time and just didnt tell me because he knew I wouldnt talk to him if I knew that. he then talks about how he just didnt want to be alone in the situation. (being homeless) I get mad , cusss him out and he leaves me in the car , at a place I dont know anything about and gets drunk. when he comes back , because I had no choice to sit there , mind you , i was also in shorts and a tank top and men were already whistling at me which brought up my sexual trauma, he comes back and hes drunk . really drunk and tries to drive. I  tell him no and use my pregnancy as a excuse as to why he shouldnt drive with us in the car like that . he snatches the keys from me anyways and drives off with one of my legs hanging out . I close the door and just pray to god he doesnt wreck in nashvilles traffic . well he gets mad that im not responding to him and kicks me out of the car in the middle of the highway. im stubborn so I get out of the car and grab my phone . I begin to walk and he chases me in his car and begs me to get back in . at this point i see that this man is bipolar and violent  and I will just take my chances with the streets . pregnant or not. I manage to run through some grass and across some buildings so that he can no longer find me in his car. I look at my phone , its at 1% . it dies the moment I try and make a call. as im walking I realized ive walked a complete circle and ended up on the backstreet back to the park . (might be why he gave up on chasing me now that I think about it) and I see his car. windows down and he always leaves the key in because he will shoot anybody messing with his car. I tried to sneak up to the car but i had on bright colors and was easily seen . he sends two men over to me to get me to “talk to him” which I now realize was just a intimidation move . I told him my fear of men , especially sexually and he used that agisnt me often. I ended up staying unfortunately. I know it seems stupid but I was scared . he used to be a drug dealer in the area when he was younger and know alot of the men around there and I was afraid if I left I would end up getting raped or something so I rather of stayed with the rapist I atleast knew versus be raped by a random. thats crazy now that I say it but thats the truth. on top of the fact I dont talk to any of my family because of the resentment I hold towards them for the things that happened to me previously. from that point forward we were homeless for months and this man made 25+ dollars a hour. I had to have sex with him and be lovey dovey with him in order to eat , sleep in a comfortable spot, be left alone etc . if i didnt he would have me sleep under picnic tables , in the rain , not eat , he wouldnt let me wash no matter if i did what he said or not because of some fetish he had and he wanted me to smell bad. he actually would Ejaculate inside of me and not let me wash that out. he refused to stop doing that.  which to me was both just another way to degrade me. He even had complete control over my phone so I couldnt contact my family. 


we ended up getting in a wreck memorial day/weekend and I got threw over a guardrail . I bled from that point forward vaginally and believe I lost one of my babies from that. a drunk driver hit us while broke down on a highway . I ended up getting 3k from the insurance company from that . I didnt get but maybe 200$ out of that in which he made me spend on wigs and new clothes bexause he was “embarrassed “ of how i looked now. shortly after he had my money he took me to a cook out and said it was a bunch of his family there . I had no other choice but To go since I depended on him solely for everything. I was pretty big at 3 months. and he refused to get me any prenatal care . (so much so that I went into labor a couple months later and got refused at multiple hospitals for anything because I had no prenatal care) 


we get to the cookout and all these family members are actually a big ass congregation of people who molested me . no exaggeration. he knew of my abuse and brought me there anyways . and I feel like that was a way of him belittling me some more . he then later got drunk and asked me if I remember him . and I asked him what he was talking about . he then admits that he tried to talk to me when I was 16 about to be 17 and I blocked him because of his age . and when I really sat and thought about it I actually did remember his face from somewhere. so for the next couple of months until october I was being taken advantage of by him and forced to have a baby i dont want . I ruined my body . ive lost all of my life . I never had a chance to live my life to begin with and now I got a baby so its like I cant do anything that normal 20 year olds are doing because im too busy changing diapers that I shouldnt even be changing . im not even really attracted to men. 95% of my attraction is women. he tried to convince me to be a prostitute because “pregnant women have the wettest coochies “ . and i would make alot of money and could get us out of homelessness 😐 he wouldnt let me get a job and if i made a interview appointment he would mysteriously have a reason for me to miss it. it was his car, I didnt really know how to drive and I didnt have my license . due to the bleeding during my pregnancy, I assumed my babies were dying or I was having a still birth . so I tried to drink or smoke those thoughts away and he facilitated a space for me to do so due to me not being old enough to buy those things . I eventually got home to my mother after he got offered a better job in another state ,  where he still came around to “check up” on me . my mother only found out about the drunk assault yesterday. I have pressed charges against him but it wasnt until a couple months later and I dont have any evidence. so im depressed about that. also now that I have a son , hes trying to get custody/visitation rights and I honestly dont trust him around my son and dont want my son to be anything like him. he mentioned before that since I  was having his baby I would always have to be involved with him and I cant help but think the only reason he wants visitation is so that he can have some type of hold over me. My pregnancy was so traumatizing that I refuse to ever get pregnant again and I wanted a big family at one point. I can feel the lack of compassion I have now. the dislike for men now is so strong I dont even think im really attracted to them on a serious level. i just wanna use them . thasssit! but thankyou for listening i just needed to get that off of my chest . and before you ask , yes im taking therapy but that can only do so much . this in general is making my PPD sooooo bad that i dont feel in control of anything anymore . i struggle to clean my house or myself.

i’m almost 5 months ppd and i have a confession to make...
when i was pregnant and in my 2nd trimester , i really felt awful of how i looked and started using this camera app to make myself feel better about myself...
smaller face,bigger eyes, clear skin, by then i started to feel better and took pictures of myself. come the time i gave birth and i saw my baby,she’s so precious and beautiful and i just love her! as a parent we want to take photos and videos of our child/ren to treasure the memories,so i took hundreds upon hundreds of photos and took videos of her cause she was just so cute! Earlier this day i started to print some of her photos to make a photo album,and as see them on print i was staring at it and i thought “wow she looks so pretty here!” small face,big eyes,clear skin...in that moment it started to sink in and my heart just dropped..I USED THE SAME CAMERA APP TO MY BABY! i felt so horrified of myself and i feel so guilty, i got so used to using the app that i unconciously used it on my baby too! i am just devastated and horrible of myself now..how could i distort her precious image at such a young age! what have i done....now i want to delete all the pictures and videos i took of her because i could not bear to make her look in the future of my own distorted image of her and make her feel insecure of her looks...i love my baby so much and i just feel so aweful i’ve been crying for quite a while now...all those precious moments,ruined by my own hands...i wanna disappear..",Postpartum_Depression,Confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/l6tz4l/confession/,1611856725.0,2021-01-28 10:58:45,4.8279039346753165e+17

dedestro417,"Let me start this off with the fact that I know I’m in the wrong but I can’t seem to get my head on straight.

I’ve been married to my wife for 3 years. We waited to have a baby for 2 years then suddenly we both looked at each other and realized we couldn’t think of any reasons to wait. We both wanted a child. Fast forward 9 months. We had an amazing pregnancy and were crazy excited. Home birth went great, wife is healed up, and sex life is normal already. No issues right? 

I’m sitting on my couch crying. I don’t really know why. Our baby is happy, my wife is happy, my job isn’t at risk, and I have tons of stuff to do... if I want. I don’t. I hate working, I hate sitting at home doing nothing, I hate going out to do something. My wife spends most of the time with our baby which makes sense. It needs her. When he’s napping I get her to myself for 2 hours at a time so I have no reason to complain. But for some reason here I am. I sit here in silence but I hear a static and ringing in my ears. It’s so loud it must be deafening but I hear all other noises perfectly well.

I came here to post because I know I should be happy too. I literally have it made. I’ve never had any sort of depression until I got married. Since then maybe one day every 3-4 months I’ve been absolutely bored out of my mind and nothing gave pleasure but I take that as a typical easy life boredom and it lasts a day at most. If this was a one day thing I wouldn’t have posted either but this has lasted a week and I think I may need help. 

I don’t care how you give it to me. Maybe I need some straight up “get off your ass” style support. I just need something. Some guy wrote a post 93 days ago that I read. It was nice to know things got back to normal for him. I’m sure they will for me too.

cherrylea,"Just when I thought I was getting better, life decides to be extra hard and give my grandma COVID-19, keep her in a hospital for a month and never let her out again, at least in life. 

I have switched meds so many times that I don’t want to take them anymore. But I do cuz it helps. Somewhat. I started talking a mood stabilizer twice to see if my emotions can be in a straighter line instead of being so extreme in each end. Sometimes I think I’m bipolar tbh.  Anyways, Is it helping? I have no clue. I have had more depressive episodes in a week than I did when I got diagnosed. I’m starting to feel that despair feeling I did when I got diagnosed. Everything feels dark. 

What sucks the most is that when I get mad or angry or frustrated or anything negative I yell (thanks mom and dad, even if you choose not to remember and call me dramatic and call every memory I have good or bad trauma but in a derogatory way) my daughter gets scared even when The issue is not with her. She ran away and said the word scared after I yelled at our dog for nipping at her (she’s fine. She’s not hurt, but she keeps messing with him no matter how we tell her or how many times). I have yelled at her and god is so hard to admit. The guilt is eating me especially after she expressing she was scared. 

I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. Just a couple of days I wanted to self harm, but I couldn’t find my knife.

I went from Zoloft 125mg to Wellbutrin 300mg. We decreased Zoloft little by little. Because my body was having withdrawals and giving me brain zaps, they put me on lexapro 10mg and then reduced it to 5mg. Then they added gabapentin 600mg for restless leg syndrome caused by ssri. Now I don’t take lexapro anymore and started a mood stabilizer that I take twice daily.

I am convinced my deep depression is from covid brain damage. My depression fell heavy week two of having covid in November when baby was 3 weeks. I feel nothing but despair. I feel empty. I have no soul. It feels like I died with Coronavirus, that it actually stole my personality. I can't cry. I can't even express emotion through crying. I feel no joy.. not an ounce of joy for months. I feel impaired.

I can't concentrate. I don't know what's going on around me.. I know its common for moms with PPD to think their babies would be better off without them, but I actually believe this is true... If I am brain damaged and mentally ill from this virus, my being near the baby will harm her.

Her father loves her, but I wish I could give her a two parent home or happy family. I'm so despairing that we got this virus and that my neurological system is messed up. Seeing pictures of myself when pregnant pre covid breaks my heart, I was happy then. I want to scream into the picture to tell her to stay at her parents' house, not to move in with the father of the baby because he brought corona to them. It all seems so final and damning and hopeless. That the happiest time of my life would be followed by the most miserable. And that as hard as I tried to avoid the virus, it got me and had life altering effects.

I have a therapist, have been hospitalized at a psychiatric hospital, am on medication, and have tried and will try whatever I can. At this point I'd let them cut my brain open for a chance at feeling even a day of joy again, instead of this empty nothingness dread. I don't want my baby to suffer!  I wish she could be adopted by a loving happy family... instead she has a brain damaged mom who is obsessed with what happened to her and can't even control her own mind anymore. 

Im considering moving out so that she never has to see me like this.. Like maybe I see her a few times a week and push out whatever energy and fake smiles I have so that she doesn't have to see when I'm so miserable and disconnected. 

Life feels so unfair. I clawed my way out of so much to only be sent to this terrible place.

Background-Bear-5849,"In June 2019 my husband and I had our first baby. A month later, we moved to a different state. I was extremely anxious about this move because I wasn't familiar with the area/knew no one there, I was recovering from a pretty traumatic delivery/birth, and I was a new stay at home mom to a one month old baby. About a month after we moved, I began having physical symptoms such as dizziness and just feeling off. At my postpartum checkup, my dr did a cbc &amp; checked my iron, which was normal. I thought it was just from breastfeeding or lack of sleep at first. Eventually, the dizziness went away, but I started feeling really weak and drained. I went to the doctor again who thought it could be postpartum anxiety and I started taking a low dose of Zoloft (which I took until September of 2020). Throughout this time, I would have good days and bad days with my symptoms. Some months even were better than others. In July 2020, we moved back to our home state. After I weaned my son completely from breastfeeding in October, I started feeling worse. I just feel weak and drained most days, kind of like when you have the flu but no other symptoms, just the weak feeling. It is worse in mid morning/afternoon and gets a little better in the evening. Some days I will have a good day where I don't feel it as much, and other days I feel so bad I just want to lay down all day. The fatigue also gets much worse during my period, like I feel like I can barely function I get so weak for the first few days. I went to the doctor and had blood work done (CBC, CMP, thyroid panel, iron panel, ferritin, vitamin d), all came back fine.

I've struggled with PPD and PPA since my son was born almost 11 months ago. I am in telehealth therapy sessions, on meds, and overall doing well. 

Recently my fiance and I hit a rough patch financially. 28 days ago, two users on reddit reached out to me via one Assistance post to help with my son. 

I have never been more grateful in my life! A day ago I posted a thank you to the sub, and a user reached out to help me. I accepted the help under the condition I'd comment on their recent post saying they'd helped me.

Well, now I have mods and other users attacking and downvoting me over $10 for groceries...I returned the money yesterday as soon as the chaos began, and have sent proof of this to the mod that requested it, but since then my inbox has been blown up calling me every name in the book. 

I am in tears. I didn't ask for any more help, I was simply accepting an offer from a fellow mom....f me I guess for accepting unsolicited help, which has been so hard for me and has been something I've worked for years on with my therapist....just want to curl up and cry right now

my boyfriend, son and I lived with my dad to save for a home but they worked all day long and everyday I was alone. alone alone alone. bored, struggling, nervous to be around my son all day. waking up dreading another day alone, having to plan activities for us, trying to get out of the house but having to turn back due to my son crying bloody murder the minute we left the house. (absolutely hated car rides)

Fast forward today. I’m feeling so absolutely empty and so uninspired. Scrambling to fill my days with activities, signing him up for anything I can (covid permitting)

Still so nervous to spend my days alone with him. Never feeling in the moment, happy, enjoying play time with him. 

I hate the way motherhood has been so far and I can’t help but look at pictures of new first time moms and wish I could do it all over again and change things. I just feel like i’ve done so much wrong from the start. I just feel so negative about myself and my parenting. 

I have no friends, my mom passed away from sulfide 2 years ago, I try to make friends but I can’t seem to keep them around. I’m caring, I’m kind, I’m bubbly, but it’s like I’m a repellent or something. 

I just want life to feel easier and to enjoy my son and to enjoy my life as a mom, not constantly comparing myself to others and wishing my life away.

JTZ86,"I’m 5.5 months postpartum with my second child. I have a three year old daughter and a 5.5 month old son. I was feeling great until he turned 4 months old. Then the PPA/PPD hit me like a ton of bricks. Now all I want to do is run away and I regret having him (even though he’s a pretty good baby). I’m just so sick of thinking about sleep/naps/feeding/schedules/wake windows/etc. All I do is think about his sleep to the point that I can’t sleep myself. I watch the monitor with every nap. I sleep trained him for night but I still wake up at like 5am and start watching the monitor scared he might wake up and now that will affect my day. I can’t live like this. Last night I woke up at 3:45am for no reason other than my anxiety was through the roof. 

He sleeps ok. Naps are a bit challenging and he sleeps about 10.5 hours at night without any night feeds. I just can’t shake this. I had PPD/PPA with my daughter but felt better by 5 months. I can’t believe I’m feeling WORSE as he gets older. 

I’m already on Zoloft and seeing a psychotherapist. I’m just obsessed with his sleep and how it might impact the next day or the morning or my own sleep.

Playful_Jellyfish_12,I’ve always had depression. I’ve always been on Zoloft. My daughter was born at the beginning of January 2020. Then the pandemic hit. I was doing okay. I mean it was summer at least...around 9 months when I got my first postpartum period my mental health started really going downhill. I started drinking more and more. I’m finally 4 days sober after a really rough week...I hate myself and I think I’m the worst mother in the world. I’m alone all day everyday. My boyfriend doesn’t get home till 5 pm. Immediately goes and takes a “short” shower that ends up being 30 mins. At night I have to sleep alone because he snores so horribly I won’t sleep. Not that it matters because my daughter still wakes 2-4 times a night. My friends are all too busy for me with work and their lives. I feel utterly alone. And her comes my guilt and depression yet again. Why can’t I enjoy my daughter all day instead of staring at the tv half of the time? Why can’t I be one of those mothers who LOVES to be a stay at home mom all day? I love my daughter more than anything but I am so severely depressed. I do not want to harm myself or others. I just can’t stop crying and feeling down. I’m afraid I’ll drink again. I have an appointment with my OB coming up and I pray he can help. I’m so scared.

shmimeathand,"I had the worlds most perfect pregnancy, after living with a debilitating autoimmune disease my whole life my pregnancy brought me relief, for the first time I felt normal and GOOD. I had almost no pregnancy symptoms aside from mild SPD in the last few weeks. I was happy, energized, I had clear skin and little anxiety, I felt purpose and I was connected with my baby. My pregnancy was the easiest part of this whole journey and I didn’t realize it at the time. My birth went all wrong. It started out perfect, I went into spontaneous labor, my contractions were totally bearable, I was thinking I would get all of the things I wanted for my birth plan. But then I asked for an epidural, and it took 5 tries to place it while I felt the catheter moving in my spine, with in minutes of it being placed my sons heart rate tanked into the 60s, I spent two hours flipping every few second, watching the monitors as dozens of strangers poured in and out of the room shaking their heads. My boyfriend was terrified and I found myself having to stay calm for him even though I thought my baby was going to die inside me. I had procedures being performed on me with no explanations and then a doctor tells me I’m being taken for a csection. I sobbed and shook, I was terrified we were both going to die, I hadn’t planned for this. I didn’t get all the things I wanted out of my birth plan, no golden hour no skin to skin no seeing my boyfriend cut the cord etc, I didn’t hold my son for almost an hour, I had an allergic reaction on the operating table and could hardly see him I was in so much pain, I was high from the drugs, shaking and itching uncontrollably in the recovery room, I barely remember any of it. The first few nights the combination of pain meds and oxytocin had me nodding out every few minutes, I could barely hold my son I was terrified I would pass out with him in my arms. 

Then came breastfeeding. I left the hospital with bloody scabbed nipples, I hadn’t felt the pain because of the round the clock meds. The baby wasn’t latching right, I had vasospasms and developed thrush. I spent weeks in the most horrifying agony I’ve ever felt. I reached out to lactation consultants, family members, local la leche members, I received no help. No responses. The same people who pressured me saying I “HAD TO BREASTFEED” completely left me hanging. I was in agony, I was exhausted, my baby was frustrated and never satisfied. He wasn’t growing.  I felt like a failure. I dreaded feeding him. I wasn’t bonding with him. I hated breastfeeding. The baby would only sleep with his dad, only be calm with his dad. With me it was just frustration, being forced to try and latch over and over again, never getting it right. Sucking and sucking and never getting enough. 

Breastfeeding was destroying me mentally. But so was the idea of stopping. It was something I had always assumed was just going to be easy, just like my pregnancy. I never gave any thought to it NOT working. I didn’t buy any “back up” formula, I didn’t learn about anything other than breastfeeding. Thinking about all the people who would think I’m a failure and think I just gave up, all the people who had pressured me, I felt guilty that I cared about their opinions. What kind of mother am I that I am worried about THEM and not my son who is struggling, or my son who’s mother was struggling. 

I cried and cried and cried. My eyes burned. Every day was worse than the last. 

So I finally decide to add formula. But the formula makes him gassy, unsettled. He seems like he’s in pain. I feel guilty. Like I’ve poisoned my son. He tolerated breast milk just fine, sleeping 6 hour stretches when his dad fed him bottles of pumped milk. Now he writhes, grunts and strains all day. Why could I just give him what he wanted. 

Why is it one step forward two steps back? Why is nothing going right for us. My boyfriend is infinitely a better parent than I am. He’s calm and understanding, the baby feels his energy and relaxes instantly. With me it is just anxiety. Uncomfortable. 
I am flailing and failing. I am a mess. 

Every day I want my baby to be older, because I blindly believe it will be easier. I feel guilt for feeling that way. I am going to miss him being this small. I am not cherishing this time because I am constantly lost, sad, frustrated. I spend every waking moment googling, reading, searching for answers. I can’t stop.

hopeful-pessimist13,"I tried to prepare for PPD. I clung to the hope that maybe the second time would be different, but was so proactive with my doctor's about tackling things early and keeping a close eye out. 

I have a mood disorder and was treated for it medicinally until I had an emergency c section. I had to immediately taper off PP because they were hitting me a million times harder with the hormone drop. I could hardly hold my baby and knew I needed to fast track to something more sustainable ASAP. 

Three weeks. Three weeks of no meds. The doctor handling my mental health literally left the practice as I was having my child. So within the four days I was in hospital, I was suddenly without my mental health care team. Nothing to treat PP panic, nothing for this horrible depression. There were no referrals like promised.

Fun-Watercress2603,"I am 36 and just found out that we are pregnant this past week. It was a very unexpected surprise for us, as my husband was preparing to schedule his vasectomy for next month.

This will be baby number 3 for us, and I honestly don't know that we can continue this pregnancy because of the suffering I experienced after our second child was born. 

I didn't have it after my first, but with my second, the PPD was severe and devastating. I was a panic-filled shell of a person for the first four months of my second child's life. Panic attacks hit all day long. I couldn't leave the house. I cried every day feeling like I was the worst failure of a mother. I had trouble bonding for the first NINE WEEKS of my baby's life. I couldn't sleep when it was time to sleep. I became underweight from an inability to eat because I was so stressed and depressed.

It is true to say that I have PTSD from that experience, even though I have recovered fully and am so in love with my second child I just want to hold them in my arms all day long.

I know that it isn't permanent. But I am filled with such grief and sadness and fear over the thought of even potentially experiencing that again.

I have been struggling with PPD for the past 7 months (my son is 11 months). It took me 4 months to muster the courage to even reach out to my midwife and ask for help, and admit my mental health was deteriorating. It was hard to ask for help - probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. My midwife was understanding, compassionate, and prescribed me Lexapro in conjunction with a referral to a psychologist who specializes in women's health &amp; wellness. It has been 2.5 months since I've been on medication and in therapy. It has been life-saving. Getting help allowed me to regain my sanity, my clarity of thought, and start moving in the right direction for better overall health. I am a more present mother, a happier wife, a more productive employee, and a kinder friend. I feel like the cloud of PPD has lifted and I'm out of the deepest ditches of it. I still have PPD, I still have bed days, but therapy and medication have helped me be self-compassionate and patient. Now, instead of spiraling out of control into panic attacks and uncontrollable crying fits, I ride the wave of the bad day/increased depression. I tell myself it will pass, and it does. I am now stable enough mentally to start focusing on my physical health and nutrition. Before getting help, I was simply existing as a fragmented version of myself. Now, I am surviving and I am making progress to start thriving. 

Mamas, please ask for help. You need it. You deserve it. Your baby needs you to get help, and your baby deserves a mama who is healthy. Please know: it gets better. It really does - and I know it does from personal experience.

So my doctor prescribe me a new medicine and it makes me extremely tired with my son being all over the place I can’t get any sleep and I also have no help at home. So I’ve been getting super irritated and frustrated because I have no idea what to do she says that I have to wait for it to kick in to my system so I won’t feel tired anymore but it’s torture to have to deal with my son and be so tired. His father and I don’t live together but we are together he just started a new job and can’t come by and help because he doesn’t have a car he’s currently using his landlords to get to work and then he has to bring it right back. I don’t know what to do I’m gonna cry the situation just really sucks and is really hard.,Postpartum_Depression,Tired help,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/ksu19f/tired_help/,1610101558.0,2021-01-08 03:25:58,7.355192788407273e+18
boymomma421,"Bare with me, this is my first time posting. 

Quick story time: I’m 20 years old, had a baby boy in April 2020. My sons father and I were together throughout my whole pregnancy and even before that. I found out one day before my maternity shoot that he cheated on me before I got pregnant.. it totally broke my heart. I decided to stay and forgive him. 3 months later, my son was in fact 3 months old, that my sons father comes back from work and he showered, ate and fell asleep. It was about 4am and I was up feeding the baby when I hear his phone go off. He got a notification from Instagram from a woman and again I found out he cheated on me. 

I ended up leaving him and honestly it broke my heart that I had a broken family with my son being so young. I come from one so I didn’t want my son to go through the same. I should mention that I had postpartum depression as well. I fell heavily depressed, and I know I need to get up off my ass and go back to college and get a job for me and my child. I need to work but something in me doesn’t want to. I want to But I just can’t. I feel so depressed and I don’t wanna cause a pity party but idk I just feel so empty. I need to get help from a therapist or something. Or get antidepressants. Has this happened to other moms or not?

valuesinmumsresearch," Hello all,

My name is Cassie, I am currently training as a Clinical Psychologist and as part of my doctorate I am looking for new mums to take part in some important research.

Although becoming a mum can be a wonderful experience, it can also be a stressful and difficult time. We are interested in understanding what is important to new mums and seeing if there is a relationship between our personal values and the experience of low mood/postnatal depression.

If you are a new mum (18 and older), currently experiencing low mood/depression and **are not** currently receiving support from a mental health team, we would like to invite you to take part in our study.

This **anonymous online study** takes approximately 15 minutes to complete and as a thank you for your time we are offering participants the opportunity to enter a draw to **win 1 of 3 £25 Amazon vouchers.**

For more information or to participate in this study please follow the link: [https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_eDJquYKsC2KMFE1](https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eDJquYKsC2KMFE1)

Any support you can give with this study would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read,

QueenElizabeth13,"Hello all! I am new to this subreddit and I am hoping to connect with some of you who may have dealt with similar issues as I have.

I gave birth to my daughter in July. I had a relatively easy pregnancy and delivery. After she was born, I was on cloud 9. I felt wonderful. But that all came crashing down 3 months later after a health scare with my husband - something that wasn't even a huge deal. Ever since that day it has been like a switch was flipped and I am constantly worrying. Panic all day every day. I have very little enjoyment in life. I am back at work and being here is toxic for my mental health but I have to keep my job for the benefits.

I have dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life but what I am dealing with is a whole new level. Prior to what happened, I hadn't been medicated in several years as I was able to function without it. I started therapy and even my counselor suggested I see my OB to possibly get on a medication that was safe for breastfeeding. My OB has been a huge help. I am now on Welbutrin which has helped but I feel fucking terrible any time I am away from my baby.

My parents watch my daughter while I am at work. Both at 66 and I constantly worry about them, their health, what if something happens to them while they are watching my daughter, when are they going to die, etc. I can't afford child care and there is no way in hell I would trust my first child to a daycare where I live even if I could afford it. I am a wreck. I thankfully have some resources that I can take to possibly start working from home, which will help but I am so tired of feeling the way I do. Even when I am with my daughter, anxiety, and depression are still there. I want to enjoy my days again. I want to enjoy spending time with my family and my daughter without my heart constantly racing and thinking these irrational thoughts.

I had planned to have a second child but this has made me consider being a one child family. I don't want to go through this again if I am able to get out of this funk. Some days are better than others but I just want to feel the happiness I felt before. I want my life back.",Postpartum_Depression,My PPD/A is out of control,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/krsg3p/my_ppda_is_out_of_control/,1609979034.0,2021-01-06 17:23:54,7.285375534367608e+18

lostandwanderin,"Lately I’ve been having a really hard time. I’m in therapy but I couldn’t tell you if it’s helping. I am constantly worried, about everything. I go down unnecessary rabbit holes that just spiral me. On top of that my son has developed these little “tremors”. I didn’t think anything of it until I realized what I use to help him sleep .. an iPhone playing a YouTube video of shhhh-ing. I used to put it right next to him. For hours. I did this for months. I did it in the hospital for God sakes the day he was born. 

As I type this I can’t even see through the tears because I feel like my carelessness of microwaving my sons brain could have caused these “tremors”. We have an appointment with the neurologist at the end of the month and I don’t even know how I’m going to manage because I just feel like I ruined him. 

I can’t talk to my husband about it because he just tells me to stop, and that it’s not my fault and that I didn’t cause it. Which is true, this could all be nothing, it could be something genetic (as epilepsy runs in my family) or it could be I microwaved my sons brain.

  My LO is 4 months old. He has had colic since he was 2 months old. I got diagnosed with PPD at his 2 month mark...I was told to take prozac and to get help but with all calls I made no one got back to me. I've called about 6 different people but to no avail. 

  My son is teething now and has colic at the same time, I've yelled at him three times in total which I feel  really bad about because he put his bottom lip put and made the sound he makes when he gets scared. I have now loudly sung his favorite song to yell and he doesn't mind that, I have quite a few disabilities. One is called chiari which I can pass down to him, I have cysts in my spine a pars defect and scoliosis. 

I'm struggling daily, I do all the chores around the house mainly take care of my baby boy. My fiance is really bad with momey and just got paid Thursday and just has 10 dollars left. On top of all of this I don't drive so I never get out of the house and if I do get to go out it's a struggle with my fiance who says every time I want to get out of the house ""Do we have to go to ""xyz"".

wannabebabymamma,"My LO is 8 days old, and she is wonderful. She's an easy baby so far, and the most adorable little thing. But, motherhood has NOT made me feel how I was expecting. I was so so excited for his stage, and now I'm nothing but emotional, stressed and overwhelmed. 

I cry ALL the time. During the day, I cry because I love her, I cry because I'm worried she isn't eating enough, I cry because she won't move her little hand out of the way while I try to get her to latch. 

But, at night, it's a whole new ballgame. Firstly, I cry every evening around 5pm because its getting dark. I don't know why, but when I see its getting dark, I get very close to having a panic attack. I think it may be because her ""witching hour"" is right around 10-12pm, and the thought of needing her comfort a very awake and tearful baby makes me very anxious. I also get this wave of loneliness that feels different at night. Like that I just wish someone (other than my husband, who is there and who is amazing) could be there to talk with me and help me through. 

Then, after getting over the fact that it's dark, I just cry. No reason. I just cry for an hour or 2 straight. I get frustrated because I can't explain why I'm upset. I was sitting there last night watching Karate Kid, baby fast asleep and I was balling my eyes out. 

I know I'm still very much in the hormonal take over stage of post partum, and that these feelings may fade rather than turning into fill blown PPD, but it's a lot to handle.

So as the title explains, my sister has postpartum depression. She had twins a few months ago and it really messed with her. At first she was willing to seek help and then she suddenly stopped going to therapy and stopped taking her medicine. We have no idea why and her husband is too much of a coward to ask her or push her. I’m concerned about her. She isn’t eating right, tries to sleep in until noon (would probably sleep all day if she could) and lashes out at her family (us) over the smallest things. Our mom has an old way of thinking and just says “oh she’s sick, let’s just give in because it’s easier”. She lashed out at my other sister and I earlier this week and refuses to talk to us. Part of me just wants to apologize but the other part knows what we weren’t wrong in the argument. I have no problem apologizing but what’s to stop her from lashing out at us again and not change her behavior because she thinks we’ll just give in and apologize? Her husband is “more scared of her” then we are (+ he works really long hours at a hospital).

philherupdelphia,"I had my first panic attack last week, and I’ve had one every day ever since. My baby is soon to be five months old. I felt depression coming on at six weeks, but it went away for a while. The loneliness of quarantine has finally caught up to me. I dread being alone. Ever since that first panic attack I’ve started doubting my strength and sanity. Then another one comes. I realize now I cannot go on without therapy or some kind of medication because I can’t do this alone anymore. I love my baby very much, and she deserves better. When I feel this helpless I think about how limited my life is now with a baby; I long for my life before her; I beat myself up for thinking these things; on and on and on.

coppolaseyes,"This is such a stupid problem, but it's completely overwhelmed me and I can't cope. I've been struggling on and off with my mental health since my DD was born 11 weeks ago. I've been doing okay for 2 weeks nearly, but Christmas has completely set me off. 

We've not been able to see any family since she was born, until Christmas which we spent with the whole family: 3 sets of grandparents, 3 sets of uncles and aunts. At first it was wonderful finally being able to hand her off to people and not having her constantly on my chest, but it got old quite quickly. 

When I'd greet people - my own family - they'd completely ignore me and start cooing at DD. Sometimes they wouldn't even make eye contact and I'd have to raise my voice to even be noticed. Every time she cried I'd be completely on edge. Family would completely ignore my advice on how to soothe her, do everything I'd specifically tell them not to because it was a quick fix, and then they'd get irate when lo and behold she'd start screaming again 5 minutes later from being over-stimulated. Or she'd finally settle with one person, and then be immediately handed off to another person, waking her up and upsetting her. 

In some ways it was comforting feeling my maternal instincts kick in when she cried, and reassuring when I'd take her back and she'd instantly settle in my arms. It made me feel like I wasn't entirely broken, that I was, indeed, mama bear. 

We spent a couple of days with family and came back yesterday. It took 2 cars to bring back all her stuff and presents. It took hours to unpack all of her presents and most of her clothes are still in half-organised piles around the house. I have been completely overwhelmed since. Our actual gift requests have been completely ignored, as usual, and instead grandparents and uncles have bought whatever they want, refusing to talk to each other about what they were getting so we have doubles of everything we don't want, and zero of everything we've asked for.

 This happened a lot, of course, during the pregnancy, but now I'm close to bursting. The selfishness of it has completely knocked me sideways. No one is respecting the kind of parents we are trying to be, no one is respecting my knowledge of my own daughter, no one seems to care that I'm her mother. I'm just the vessel that brought their granddaughter into the world. I talk about the trauma I suffered during the birth with years in my eyes and all they have to say is ""but it's worth it for such a beautiful girl, and you'll forget about it when it comes to having your second one."" No words of comfort, no understanding, no acknowledgment of my pain. It's like my depression isn't real because I'm not real, I'm just necessary attachment that comes with the baby (though seeing as we've had more offers to babysit than invitations to visit as a family, I'm not sure they even see me as a necessary).

It's not that my family don't love me, of course, it's just the way people behave around babies that make mums feel invisible, and make PPD worse. The presents are just a symbol of the mentality of grandparents. And they feel like added pressure. Up until now my daughter has had 1 toy (she's 11 weeks old, it's all she needs!) But now she's got a houseful of them and I feel suddenly or of my depth, like I'm not entertaining her enough, like I have to dress her in these (sometimes hideous) impractical clothes that make for difficult nappy changes and that don't fit over her cloth nappies because they're gifts and everyone wants to know if she's worn any of the 15 outfits they've bought. They think they're showering their granddaughter with affection, but instead they're just weighing their daughter down with pressure and guilt. 

Local Covid restrictions have just gotten tighter, and I'm glad to have an excuse not to see anyone for a while.

BobbysueWho,I reached out to everyone who took my insurance and said they work with postpartum in my area that was on physiology today. Not one response. At my babies last wellness check they had me fill out the questionnaire about how I was doing and then told me it was probably time to seek help. I asked how and they asked if I had a regular doctor I told them no and they said if you did they could probably help you with that. So am I supposed to make an appointment with a regular doctor to ask them to find me a therapist? Or do I make an appointment with an OB and ask them to find me one? My babies check ups ate with a doctor at the family health center. I had been seeing my midwife there before the baby was born and thought that the doctors there were the doctors have seen when I was sick yet no one specifically. I don’t understand why they could not give me a recommendation or some direction. I need a separate appointment to make another appointment?!?

briellapantoja99,"My son is two years old. I myself have PTSD and severe depression that is from a quite terrible childhood. I hate pills I hate medication and all that jazz so I never wanted to quite see a doctor asking if it’s postpartum depression on top of my normal depression I have just for them to tell me to take more pills but at this point I feel I have to. My son compared to “most toddlers” is not bad at all and I should feel absolutely lucky. He sleeps all night ever since he was a baby and he eats good, and doesn’t throw many tantrums like I’ve seen my friends and family’s kids do. 

Anyway, my only source currently as a stay at home mom who’s in school during this pandemic where I can burn that bad energy and anger and annoyance out of me is when I work out. Except, I work out while my son is up now that he’s bigger because I hate working out super late at night and I don’t do mornings. Even now I feel I have zero space for myself. I want to love my son. I want to feel like he’s mine and not someone’s kid who got dumped on me. I read to him, get him everything a child could possibly ask for, but at the end of the day...I just feel a huge hole in my heart ever since he was born? I feel I am not giving him the love and attention he or any child deserves. I have an amazing boyfriend who does so much for me...but I get these episodes where I just don’t want to talk. I lock myself in the bathroom if he’s home and just cry it all out. I’ve stopped trying to keep communication with friends even if they texted me a lot. It’s been months not going out to see them ever since a year has passed having my son. I feel so tired and I just don’t want to put any energy in friendships especially knowing I have been screwed over by more than just one person who I have given my all to when they have nothing because I’m a loving person like that. 

It’s been two years, I would think my postpartum depression would be go away around now but it feels it’s gotten worse. I just want to love my son. I want to stop feeling emotionless. I want to stop having to go in the bathroom every few days crying in place of wanting to kill my self sometimes. It’s just so much. I have no family to turn to even so it’s just my boyfriend who I have any love and affection from during these times. I wish I was me again. At 22 I feel 50. I lack any motivation I had when I didn’t have my son.

And sometimes I feel like screaming at her to shut up and then I break down into sobs about the guilt.

revolutionutena,"I had my baby a little over six months ago. My husband and I had been on an absolutely nightmarish infertility journey for about 3 years prior to this, and finally being able to have a successful pregnancy felt like a miracle. I do feel like one of the issues was that I got so focused on getting pregnant I lost sight of the ultimate outcome of having a baby. 

I was 28 weeks exactly when the pandemic hit and everything shut down. In some ways this was great as it meant I WFH my entire 3rd trimester with a very slow workload (I'm a therapist at a university - very few students were thinking about telehealth therapy last spring.) All my classes had been canceled including newborn care, tour of the hospital, and breastfeeding. I had no idea how to care for a baby, and my husband is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair so we really needed that tour. 

The birth experience was traumatic - I'll do the shortcut version and say I pushed for 3 hours, they told me a C-Section wasn't possible but were worried he was hung up on my pelvis (he wasn't, he was just enormous - 4th degree tear enormous), and then they gave me a medication post-birth that sent me into a feverish delirium so I missed the first hour of his life. No skin to skin, no first attempt at breastfeeding, no first moments snuggling with him and sweet pictures.  

Then the baby had some medical complications in the hospital (breathing) that they couldn't figure out so he was whisked away all the time for tests. When he was in the room with us, I couldn't get to his little bassinet because of my 4th degree tear and my husband couldn't get to him because of it wasn't accessible from his wheelchair. So we had to listen to him scream until the nurses could come get him and hand him to me - often took several minutes. The LCs who came to visit me ignored all my questions and responded to ""This really hurts"" with ""It shouldn't."" The doctor following up on his medical issues was both condescending and vague, and once they figured out his medical issue (it was minor) and we begged to go home, he essentially questioned whether or not my husband and I could take care of him given his disability. 

I spent the first 2 days still trying to breastfeed and wanting to die - the nurses told me I had to feed him for 30 minutes on each side, then pump for 30 minutes, and by the way he eats every 2 hours. So based on that I would get 30 minutes a cycle of not doing some sort of BFing. I gave up after 2 days which immediately lifted my suicidal ideation but brought on a BUNCH of judgment from 2 of my sisters in law who are massive lactivists and who sent me books about how I was harming my baby by giving formula.

It's basically been a roller coaster ever since. We have no family nearby and very little support from friends or coworkers. We have a nanny for when we work and I thought this would mean I would see the baby a lot but I'm so busy I rarely do - I mainly see him in the evenings when he's cranky. 

On the days I do get more time with him (weekends or right now when our office is closed) I feel overwhelmed and like I have no energy. I wake up in the mornings and just don't want to get up or parent, but I know there's this little life that depends on me and I have to. I feel like I don't engage with him like I should, help him with his milestones, etc. I also feel like he doesn't trust that I will take care of him or help him when he cries because I seem to so rarely be good at soothing him when he does - he's a great little self-soother and honestly it feels like it's because I'm so shit at it he just has to do it himself.

Overall I feel completely underwater, no energy, no enjoyment of parenting, just a horrific sense of dread every morning. And then the guilt because we worked so hard for this baby and now I can't even do what I need to do.

Comprehensive-Hope13,"well I guess first I should start off with some facts.. I met my boyfriend in April of 2019, I was 17 (about to turn 18) and he was 24. I had previously been in a abusive and controlling relationship before I met him. We worked at the same job and one day he asked for my number. At first it was amazing I felt like I was finally getting what I deserved out of life like the stars were all aligning. A few months in around July , we began to get in small arguments and in my eyes it looked like another failed relationship headed down the drain. There were sexual complications as-well, only having sex if it was initiated by me. I guess because of the slight age barrier he must have felt uncomfortable coming on to me.

 

I felt very undesired and when I spoke on it the issues weren’t fixed and it really sucked because I really thought this was gonna be my shot at genuine healthy love. I made the choose of meeting up with the ex I previously mentioned and having sex with him. I guess I felt like if I wasn’t going to be happy with anybody else I might as-well run back to what in some ways felt “safe”, disappointment is always easier when it’s what you expected.. right? Non the less I felt ashamed and regrets it immediately, I made the decision to tell my boyfriend what happened right away.

 

I realized I wanted to make it work with him but knew I couldn’t go our whole relationship holding on to lies. I wanted him to know what happened and have the decision to stay or go, I felt he deserved that. We decided to try to make it work and I spent the next few months trying to do all I could to make it right and never did it again. I feel like it’s important to included that around this same time he was kicked out by his stepfather and mother because they’re house didn’t have the space for him and left with no options but to live in his car till he found a place. I was doing all I could for him.

 

Making sure he ate , washing his clothes at my house , keeping his clothes at my house , sneaking him in my parents house some nights just to have a warm bed , making sure he had a place to shower and brush his teeth everyday. Anything I could do to improve his quality of life while he was stuck in this horrible situation. I would have gave him everything I had if it meant seeing him sleeping in his own bed again but unfortunately neither of us had the money to get our own place yet. While this was all going on we found out I was pregnant with his child in October 2019. It was a very stressful pregnancy, I had HG for those of you who don’t know what that is, it’s a illness some pregnant women develop which leads to severe morning sickness I could barely eat without throwing up and ended up in the hospital a hand full of times.

 

Even water would make me puke so you can imagine how stressed I was. He tried to be there for me the best he could. In December 2019 we finally had moved into our own little apartment. This is when it really got bad. Lots of steaming and fighting. I was very stressed and very hormonal from the pregnancy and developed a habit of wanting everything to be clean and spotless I would nag about him not cleaning up and it would often lead to fights.

 

I was very irritable and easy to set off. He began to drink very heavily , picking me up from work some nights completely drunk and treating me very rude after I finished 12 hour shifts while pregnant. I believe this is when his cheating started. He was texting women receiving naked pictures from them and touching himself to them. Talking to them about me. Just emotionally and sexual entertaining them. Lots of them. Some even being exs, although most were randoms. I don’t know if he ever met up with or had sex with any of them because I was never able to get it out of him but he swears he couldn’t bring himself to take it that far.

 

I caught him in a few lies over the months but was to oblivious to really see the bigger picture. This continued on for most of my pregnancy and even continued after I gave birth to our daughter in May 2020. I’d say around September 2020 is when many of the real truths came out and I started to learn what was happening behind my back while I was pregnant.  I was so angry I was so upset. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t have decency to just tell me how he felt and what was going on especially after I had the respect to tell him what I did in the beginning of our relationship. Why did I not receive the same?

 

I was there for him at his lowest point while he was living in his car but he wasn’t there at my most vulnerable part of mine during my horrible pregnancy ? we have been trying to make it work for a few months now but I feel like such a shell of a person I’m constantly have flashback of what he did. I’m constantly thinking of all the times I thought everything was fine and this was all going on without my knowledge. Im constantly paranoid it will happen again. I feel like I’m constantly looking all around me. I want to just erase this whole chapter of my life but I can’t because my daughter is the physical embodiment of what happened to me , a percent scar and reminder of the horrible time in my life.

 

I love her to death but sometimes I still look at her and feel the need to run away from her and him. I feel angry that I kept her. But I don’t want to. He’s tried to make it up , words gifts actions sex. You name it. And he really has turned out to be an amazing father I love the way he loves that little girl. But I still feel no better. Or I’ll feel better for a day or two maybe even a week then it’s like it all starts over again. I have nightmares and flashbacks. I’ve gained so much weight from the pregnancy and stress and don’t even care to work on my self because I feel worthless.

 

I feel like no matter what I’ll never be the girl he wants or the mother my daughter needs. I feel trapped. I can’t stop comparing myself to these women he was talking to I can’t stop asking all the what ifs. I feel so unsure of my future and feel like I would rather die than continue. But I couldn’t do that because more than anything I don’t want my daughter to have the traumatic childhood that I had.

bored_pedokiller7,"I dont have funds to get help, im poor, i dont feel much emotion most of the time, i cant understand emotion anymore. I have a two year old, never wanted her in the first place. I go through periods of i love her! to im suicidal and just want to die. Ifyou think im selfish, thats fine....usually i would care and worry what others think but i don't.  I dont feel much of anything these days. My toddler would be screMing her head of and i just stare emotionless like im watchong paint dry on a wall. She would throw a tantrum and i would just pretend she is not there. She would be playing outside and i would not care...i feel like something is wrong but i just feel so hollow i can't  get the strength to get up and act like a mom. I just feel like im a failure, a nobody, i dont enjoy anything anymore, my existance is meaningless. I cant talk to anyone, they all have their own problems. How do i get help with no money? I can barely look at my daughter with a smile, farless be a parent. I actually fantasize about her going away forever or never being born. I dont want this, ANY of this.

It might just be the post partum talking haha....

The father is there, i love him and he helps me alot, but sometimes i wish i broke up with him and/or we never met. Then we would not have a child that i have to take care of with post partum, ontop of my already depressive disorder that i had before being a mom....

So now i have two depressive disorders, post partum  and whatever depression i had since the age of thirteen. Been suicidal since the age of thirteen too. Im rambling i know. But, ive been having a suicidal episode from since last week, and its just not going away. I dont care about anything except dying right now, motherhood feels like a ball and chain.

I couldn't bring myself to bathe, and now i have to take care of a human that depends on me. I have to distract myself or else i might like the idea of killing myself too much.

Its my mental disorders talking....i just want to vent all the poison and toxic thoughts so i can keep the suicidal thoughts and voices in my head at bay a little longer. The father and i dont live together, i live with my parents btw.

How does everyone get through this? I am so uncomfortable in my body.. I am completely and utterly embarrassed.   The thought of myself brings me to tears..  I have gained and lost so much weight over the last 10 years, I will never be able to be confident in my body again, I have loose skin already weighing in at 208lbs.. I know how loose my skin will be once I lose the weight I need to.  I'll never be ""fit"" again and I'm struggling with it. 

I am having such a hard time finding happiness and excitement in this second pregnancy because of every negative feeling I have about myself.   I can't stand the idea of gaining all this weight again for this pregnancy and struggle to get it off again!  I was 5 freaking pounds away from my pre pregnancy weight when I got a positive test. I am crushed..    I know I am going to love this baby, I am just struggling with it all.

DragonAtlas,"The standard cry. She'll look at me and had lips will turn downwards and her eyes will fill with tears. Then the first little cry cough turns into a low crescendoing wail. All the while, I know what is happening, I know what is coming, but I can't do anything about it, no matter what I try. She stares me in the eye as it grows and I'm am powerless.

Then comes the choked cry. The one where she is upset enough that she doesn't have enough time to clear her through properly or take a real breath between wails. The gurgle that comes out instead increases the intensity a thousand times and it rattles around my head like a pinball. Every breath is a high score.

The tiny dejected sobs. The ones that shake her entire body but the volume has decreased. I know I've failed her, and she has given up. There is no getting better, and I'm just there, useless, and she is alone. 

The cry of varying pitch. She will be normal crying and then a burst of energy makes me aware that she thinks I haven't noticed. It's tinged with anger and there is no reasoning with her. I want to tell back but what good would that do? I just have to accept my fate as an evil presence in her life. 

This quickly becomes the voice break cry. When the pitch suddenly turns into a banshee squeal, because her voice has broken and is so sore. It sounds like she is being tortured. I am the source of the torture. Nothing I can do will convince her otherwise.

The disappointment cry. The one where something dangerous is taken away from her. The one full of betrayal and the begining of hate. The one where she communicates best not all. This time, it IS my fault, 100%, and she wants me to know it. Her lips turn blue as she refuses to take a breath between sobs. It's just a silent gagging, to punish me. Eventually she takes a deep breath, and releases an explosion. I deserve it.

The cry of fear. She wakes up, safe and cozy in her crib, warm and loved, but she wasn't expecting it. The sheer terror in her voice cuts me so deeply. I didn't mean it, I just needed to get some sleep too. Please, forgive me.

Crazystaffylady,"I have two daughters, one who is 22 months and one who is 7 months. I had a miscarriage in between the two girls.

I had PPD after my first which was bad, it subsided quickly when I was pregnant with my now second baby. (The PPD was still severe when I was pregnant with the baby that I lost but I got pregnant with baby two very soon after I miscarried and everything subsided).

The PPD came back with a vengeance when I was 28 weeks pregnant. The last trimester was really hard and I kept experiencing repeat occurrences of reduced movement. It made me hate baby2. Everything started to sour and I felt relieved when she was out. My first night in hospital with her was awful, which just strengthened my bad feeling towards her. She was born during the first lockdown in the UK which didn’t help things.

So I’ve been having IPT therapy which helped, going through the circle of security with my mental health nurse and taking sertraline. I’m in a much better place than I was but my relationship with baby2 is so up and down with her. 

She’s just being a normal baby but I find her so difficult and I hate myself for thinking so negatively of her. 

I don’t feel like it’s ever going to get better. It’s been 7 months already and I know she deserves better as well.

Confident-Lynx8404,"Hi all, I just recently stumbled upon this page as I’m desperately trying to help my wife. So I hope that I’m not doing anything against the rules of this sub by not being the mom. But I need some advice or help or something. 

My wife and I just had a baby about two weeks ago. Since then my wife has been almost unable to sleep. She said she feels like she can’t breathe and her body jerks awake as soon as she falls asleep. She suffers panic attacks periodically that have gotten to the point where they’re debilitating. It’s gotten so bad lately that it’s almost like she can’t function normally. 

She’s talked with her OB who put her on meds, which she’s just started taking. We’re hoping those kick in and help so we can put this all behind us.

I guess the reason I’m posting is because as a husband I’m totally lost in what to do. I do as much as I can around the house and with the baby so she doesn’t have to. I try to be supportive as possible. I make her get out of the house, go for drives, walks around our neighborhood. But even after all that, she still ends up crying and unable to sleep. I feel helpless. Idk what there is that I can do to make things better, if anything at all, but any advice is welcome. 

Also, what advice or encouragement would you give to her? That I can relay to try and help?

I wrote my suicide letter. And then I thought about my babies, my fiancé, my family. Then i burnt that letter and finally told my fiancé that im struggling and have been struggling for a while. I told him how I feel as though I don’t love my daughter as much as my older daughter and how I wish she wasn’t born. He admitted that he felt the same way but doesn’t wish that she wasn’t born.

mike7792,"I am experiencing the baby blues/ post partum depression/ anxiety. 
Our son is 3 weeks old. He was a late preemie (35 weeks). I don’t feel any bond with him. He was delivered via emergency c section and spent a week in the NICU. 

From the moment he came home with us the anxiety hit. It’s a combination of so many different feelings such as, this is so difficult, regretting we ever had him, constantly fearful that my wife will burn out which would mean I’m screwed, or he has a difficult feeding and took 2 hours to finally go back to sleep. I’ve never been a very patient person and over think things and let things build up in my head so I’m certain it doesn’t help.

The pediatrician suspects our son has “grunting baby syndrome” where he is learning to pass gas or poop sleeping/laying down. 
This has actually been one of the most difficult things to deal with for me. 
So he is constantly kicking, grunting and screaming which often leads to him waking himself. I’ve been dreading putting him to sleep because the grunting syndrome has happened as soon as i lay him down or shortly after and then he’ll wake again after trying so hard to soothe and rock him to sleep. 2 hours later of unsuccessfully trying to put him to sleep and it’s now feeding time again. 

I’m literally living my life one feeding at a time. I constantly have this weight on my chest and feel quite down everyday. Spoken to my family doctor and a counsellor.

I try to bond with my baby, I try to rub my stomach and talk to her. I try to make myself get excited. At first I was buying her lots of cute clothes and other items but I’ve slowed down. I’m honestly just really really really depressed, I’m in a shitty abusive relationship and have a shitty home life and have no clue where’s a safe place I can to live after the baby’s born, so I know that’s most of the reason why I’m so apathetic about motherhood. There are times when she kicks and it honestly just makes me more depressed or makes me feel... almost annoyed? I’m really sad because I wish I was getting loving feelings and enjoying every minute of this pregnancy. I really mostly only talk to her when I cry and I apologize for the way she has to hear me cry. I’m due in 11 weeks. I have daily thoughts of giving the baby up for adoption. I feel like she deserves a mom who is excited about her, not one who cries for hours every day and night and can’t even provide her with a stable home. I have literally no family who is supportive. I haven’t had a single dream about her my entire pregnancy, and last night I finally had one. She was about 7 years old in the dream. The sad part is, when I woke up I wasn’t even happy, the whole idea of motherhood freaks me out and I just keep having this feeling that I’m not going to enjoy it and I don’t want to do it and I physically can’t do it. I didn’t have a good childhood. I fear I will give her a bad one because I don’t know how to be a “good” mom. This isn’t how I wanted to become a mother. I didn’t want to do this alone and I didn’t want to live in fear that my baby father would kill me one day. I’m just honestly wondering if it would be best for the baby to go to an adoptive family? I’ve had mental health issues all my life and I’m really reliant on marijuana and alcohol, obviously I’ve had to stop since being pregnancy, which is also part of why I’m so so so so depressed. I see videos of babies and before I was pregnant, I used to get those normal “aww cute baby” feelings. Now I literally see those videos and just think “I don’t want that..”.

DrDogMedicineWoman,"Not sure how to help myself at this point. I’ve had depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. I was in therapy and taking Prozac (still do) prior to my pregnancy. After baby came I stopped therapy just due to not having time and I was in a really good place. I was the happiest I have ever been when I was pregnant and that was despite the complications we had. I felt amazing. Since giving birth it’s been a slow slide back into depression. It’s worst right before my period, I feel numb and catatonic.

SmallTownMortician,"3 weeks postpartum, first time mom.

My husband has been home with me the whole time and its been amazing. Our little guy is only really happy when he's being held, if we put him down 3/4 of the time he cries. My husband gladly holds him so i can shower, cook, clean, poop...

He left the house today for 3 hours to go prep his equipment for work. The baby started to cry when he left, and cried on and off the entire time he was gone. I tried everything I know to soothe him, and he still cried. 

This stint my husband is going to be gone away to work camp for 5 days. The next stint will be 2 months. After just three hours today I feel so fucking worthless as a mother. I dont know how to help him and i get so frustrated after awhile and then I feel like shit for being frustrated. I feed him, change him, burp him, rock him, feed him gripe water, work his legs. Ive cut everything out of my diet trying to figure out what's wrong with my milk, but a woman can not survive on cereal and avocado toast. 

I told a 3 week old baby to shut the fuck up today. Is that what a good mother does???

Im so afraid of being left alone. I have support, but who's going to want me knocking on their door at 4am? We're not even supposed to be mixing households right now, so says the covid restrictions.

coppolaseyes,"My LO is 9 weeks old. I love her, of course I do, she's my world. But sometimes I regret the decision to become a mum. I don't know if I can cope with it. When she's awake, she can be awake for maybe half an hour max before she starts crying. I feel like I spend my days in fear waiting for her to wake up and cry. I feel like we have so little happy interaction time. My husband is always cooing with her and talking with her, and I'm just constantly afraid of talking to her and even looking her directly in the eye in case she starts crying. I have this fear that she hates me and every day I wish that I had been the one with the higher paying job so my husband could have taken the parental leave and I could have gone to work because. 

I went through a lot of trauma with the birth and I think I've kind of just pushed it to the back of my mind because my brain can't handle that AND the trauma of parenting. I dread nights. I dread days alone. I dread my husband coming home from work knowing I've done so little in the day - even though he doesn't care what gets done in the house - and knowing that the evening grizzles are going to start. 

I've not phoned my GP to book my postnatal examination yet because I don't know if I want to talk about this to the GP or not. It's not that I don't want to get help, it's just that I've sought mental health support before and I know what's on offer and, quite frankly, it's not worth the hassle. I stopped taking my anxiety medication days after she was born because it makes me drowsy and if I'm not able to sleep through the night I'm a zombie in the day. If o talk to my GP they will just put me on antidepressants (like I have the time to deal with the drowsiness and side effects I've had with them in the past?) Or they'll tell me to refer myself for therapy, which requires me finding a time when LO is calm enough for me to call, and waiting up to 6 months just to receive 6 sessions of therapy. What's the point? We can't afford to go private, and even if we could, everything's over the phone. I can't talk about this stuff over the phone while I'm home alone trying to care for my baby. 

Everything feels so hopeless. It's been a rough couple of nights, so I'm hoping I'm just tired and I'll feel better in a few days.

I also had to finish an online class so that made it worse. Some days I would go into auto-pilot mode and be super cold with baby. Some days I was a little rough handed and I remember a few times I screamed in front of him from frustration :( In the first month, I pumped most of the time because I had issues breastfeeding. I remember one time he vomited because I was scarfing down the bottle so much, just out of fear that he was hungry. I cleaned him up and I just cried so much after that. 6 months later I have flashbacks of this time and feel so much guilt. Like, why wasn’t I more patient and gentle? It wasn’t his fault that he was having a hard time eating. It’s not his fault he has to eat every hour. It’s not his fault that the only way he can communicate is by crying.

My birth was traumatic for me I know a lot of other people have probably had it harder but for me it was not at all what I expected or hopes for. Then every mom I know want to know how my birth was. Like it is a magical tale to share. Which made me feel so ashamed that it wasn’t that way for me. After 3 days in the hospital I felt like I gave up and just did what they told me. Luckily I did because after 6 hours of being fully dilated she still would not drop. Her heart rate started to flutter when I would push and I knew That though I am deathly afraid of surgery I wanted my baby out healthy and safe. Turns out she had a very short umbilical cord. No amount of pushing and waiting was going to do shit for either of us. I completely disassociate during the c-section or at least I tried to the best I could while the cut me open to rip my baby out of my body. Then shoving my guts back in and gluing me up. The process of getting her out was so fast it was like nothing after holding her it was like non of it was really happening to me then she and my partner left leaving mr on the table without them while they put me all back together. I have know idea how long it took but it was an eternity. It didn’t hurt but I could definitely feel it all. 

My partner is wonderful but he is gone foe 12 hours a day on average he gets home on either the 5:30 or the 6:15 boat. We make because he works in public he then takes a shower. By the time the boat docks he drives home and bathes we have usually lost another hour then I am trying to put the baby down by 9. Which is really me nursing her till after midnight while she sleeps for a few minutes here and there. So we generally see papa for 2:30 to 3 hours before bed. Most of that time is spent eating dinner and arguing about chores (I argue he looks sad and tries to do as much as he can tired and sad.) he has ADHD so he often runs around trying his hardest and accomplish very little but frustrating me. I wish it didn’t because I love him so much and I know he’s trying. 

I’m not diagnosed with postpartum and at first I was so distracted by everything it was all so overwhelming and at once I felt numb. Now that my partner is back at work and I have so much time to think I just feel like it is pilling on top of me. I am getting manic trying to keep the house clean while I also feel chained to the couch. I’m so mad at my partner that nothing gets done but he does so much and I feel so worthless. I know the baby needs and loves me but keeping her alive is all I can manage to do and sometimes I feel like I’m not doing a good enough job at that. She is fed and her but changed but to I read to her enough, teach, play, tummy time!! Help her to do the next big step. Am I even  a good mom? Is it normal to constantly worry your baby is going to die? I check her breathing all the time when she’s asleep when does that wear off? At some point I will feel confident my baby is going to survive and grown to be an adult right? Every stage of pregnancy was like this. Just get past this hurdle and I’ll be able to be confident the baby is going to make it to birth. Just make it past this month and the baby will make to a year..? Is that normal?

A little back story - I had a sorta tough last 8 weeks of my pregnancy, got induced at 39 weeks, had a 29 hour labor with 2.5 hours of pushing, got an infection that caused constant vomiting and a fever of 101, and after all of that, it ended in an unplanned c-section. Before my c-section, my epidural stopping working fully. So during my c-section, I could feel it all. After about 5 minutes, they decided to put me under, which meant I missed my son’s first breath, made my boyfriend miss his first breath, missed the skin to skin, missed so much. 
The first week or two, I felt very guilty and was down on myself quite a bit. But I was also extremely sleep deprived. I was better for about 2 weeks before everything went to crap. I cry probably 4 hours out of the day, there are days I feel like I should just give my bf full custody because I just feel like I’m not a good enough mom, I’m not sleeping much and only eating about 1 meal a day.

victoria-lisbeth,"Buckle up buttercup, we're going for a ride. 

After nearly five months I want to share something. And I want to share why I think some women don't end up sharing.

My son is a light in my life. I love him. I love his eyes, hair and nose. His crooked grin in infectious. I would die and kill for this child. And sometimes I just want to leave him in his crib and walk away. Then I want to break down into a panic attack because he'd be out of my sight for longer than a second.

Post partum depression and anxiety are fickle bitches that way. 

PPD isn't just sadness and blues. Sometimes its anger or apathy. Sometimes its a revolving door of everything at once. When he was born, I didn't feel he was my son. I didn't instantly connect like you hear about. For the first month it was just an autopilot of trying to make sure he stayed alive and Jesus Christ in heaven who let me leave with him?? I was riddled with the worst anxiety I've ever had. I couldn't sleep because I was panicked he would stop 
breathing. I kept on hand near him in his bassinet in case he rolled over. I silently cried at night when I tried to breastfeed him and couldn't. 

It got better. It got worse. It eventually has settled into a kind of middle ground truce. I'm majority anxious and it flips between everything else.

Thoughts are like a bullet train in my head, while my body feels like its moving through molasses in winter. And cue the anxiety because if I'm moving along that slow then how can I gettohimintimeifsomethinghappensohgodohgodohgod

Now for why its so hard to talk about.

How can you talk about it? How do you say I sometimes (lots of times, more times than I want to acknowledge) I hate being a mom. I sometimes hate my kid. Sometimes I want to just leave. Not even pack up, just go. No I'm not going to get cigarettes, I'm gone. Most times I want to scream and cry that I don't want to do this anymore don't make me. Or just cry. 

Then go from that to sleeping on the nursery floor because now the baby is in his crib and I'm terrified, petrified about to full on panic about it because he's in his crib. Panic attacks over not seeing him for a minute. Leaving him with someone, even though I know for a FACT he's in good hands. 

And you know how people are going to react/what they'll say. Well you wanted kids. Do you know how many people want kids and can't have them? Do you know what people would give to have their kid back and you're talking about just leaving? 

You know a bit how those moms who abandon their babies think. You have an inkling about their thought process, because you've had it. 

Bottom line here. Sometimes I feel/think I'm a horrible human mother wife. Even five months in. I won't feel this way forever (God I hope please). I may not feel this way tomorrow.

taylornoel217,"I had my first baby June 2019. I only recently came to terms with the fact that I had a serious case of PPD. After my husband went back to work. I was so depressed, crying all day, yelling at my kid. I was exhausted, depressed, and lonely. 
My SIL told me about me about takingcarababies.com. I sleep trained my baby and he started sleeping through the night at five months. I seriously can’t express how amazing her program is. Her Instagram constantly has success stories. (I was just reading through the posts and saw that a lot of people were struggling with baby sleep, and despite what I’ve gone through I can confidently say her program works). Even with my baby sleeping well I still struggled.
Fast forward and COVID happened and my husband started working from home, and his job is mostly waiting so he was able to help a lot with the kid. I got pregnant again and I just felt super guilty all the time that I felt like I couldn’t handle one kid by myself. I literally was terrified of having two babies because I couldn’t handle one. I felt like a terrible mom. I feel like everyone has it together and I was literally falling apart every day several times a day.
Now I have a two month old baby and my husband is home on paternity leave and now I don’t feel like I have PPD but postpartum rage. I have so much anger, and I’m scared of the effects it will have on my oldest. 
My doctor prescribed me anti depressants but I just found out my dad has a chronic depression problem and has been on anti depressants for over twenty years. I’m terrified to take them for two reasons: to become dependent on them and to not feel like myself on them.

Grimmshadow88,"He is a saint. He’s literally keeping me sane while I battle PPD. In reality, our kid is pretty good, but the small struggles we have are mountains for me. I’ve suffered depression for years before due to an untreated thyroid condition. (Under control now) Regardless, here I am with PPD anyway. I was dreading it because I had this feeling it would happen. It hit me so hard. My son has never been a good breastfeeder and it’s literally kills me that I’m not able to feed him properly. That was my first source of stress that triggered it. I started self harming. I had suicidal thoughts daily. (I sometimes still do, however fleeting) I fantasized about jumping into the ocean and just telling myself they would be better off without me. Now he’s hitting his 4 month sleep regression and I’m literally paralyzed in fear and anxiety putting him down for naps and bedtime. On top of that he’s a crappy napper, 25-30min at a time and then he’s up again. I literally never have time to catch my breath. 

Enter my husband. My beautiful, amazing, loving saint of a partner. He’s been there to hold me as I cry and have panic attacks over breastfeeding. He’s basically taken full charge of every nap and bedtime. All so I can hold on to my sanity long enough to pull out of this. When I told him I was harming myself and that I was thinking about taking my life, he just full stop took over. He knew something was wrong and he’s doing everything in his power to give me some peace. He’s working full time and I go back in January. He’s literally pulling me through this. I love him so much.

hheather87,"My son is 4 months old. He has four sisters and a brother (3 of his sisters are my stepdaughters, we're a blended fam). 

I have worked as a freelance copywriter from home for almost 7 years. I also homeschool 4 of the kids. Before the baby, I had days where I could go tan, get my nails done, take a joy ride, etc. to enjoy some time to myself, but now, I don't get that. 

My husband does a lot. He works and helps here, but he has a lack of patience and honestly I'm better at taking care of the house and the baby and the schooling. I don't want to complain about him, but we had 2 disagreements this weekend that I'm going to share.

The first: Friday evening, he comes home from work and sits down to watch TV. He takes the baby so I could get some work done. He then gets one of his daughters to take the baby. He goes to sit on the toilet, decides to take a bath, whatever. Baby starts to fuss so yeah, I get him and all my stuff and go to our room. Hubby asks what's wrong, I tell him if I came to his work and brought the baby for him to take care of, he'd understand. Cue WW3. It got heated fast, and sadly one of my main points was that I wanted to finish work as quickly as I could to spend time with him. I even sat by him while I was working and I told him I was trying to spend time with him.

Second: Last night, he loaned a friend one of his trucks for the week. Our water here is messed up from maintenance on the water lines, so I'm using bottled water for bottles. There was a case of water in the truck he loaned out. He goes to his other truck and brings back 3 opened bottles of water. I told him I won't use that for the baby as it carries the risk of an infection. Major attitude, but he went and got more water. I told him I'd take care of it, but he left without a word. Yay. The friend? Yeah, my husband spent the last 3 hours helping him. That's all fine and dandy, but I'd expect someone who can spend 3 hours on some BS (and it was some BS) to help his wife with something pretty simple without being a man baby about it. 

I'm a bit of a wreck at the moment. Zero down time. The house is a mess. You can't get real help around here. I'm considering staying with my sister for a while. I know how this sounds, but 50/50 sounds great right now. Do I really want that? No. I really just want a little help and understanding, some time alone and a date with my husband.

I am trying to see if I have postpartum depression or something else. I posted a little ago. At first I had baby blues and cried massive amounts, but now I can't cry or feel most emotions, just dread.. like a hollow empty tree.

bre_ann_a,"I (25 f) and my partner (40 m) have a two and a half month old daughter. She is our second child. Our first child died in my arms in the hospital at only 4 weeks old. I will admit, we rushed into having a second child because we were devastated when we lost our first. We would sit together while I was pregnant and imagine all of the wonderful things we would get to experience being both first time parents, and then he was taken from us as quickly as he was given to us. 

After he died, I became pregnant 6 weeks later. My second pregnancy was misery. I was already depressed and deeply mourning my son. I took antidepressants to help. Then came the sciatica. I couldn't move, sleep, BREATHE without pain. Life was horrible. I had a c-section this time for health reasons and the recovery was equally as horrible. 

Not only was my recovery horrible, my daughter was too. She cries and cries and cries. We don't know why either. We've taken her to the pediatrician sooo many times and he prescribed a few different formulas including soy formula, formula for colic, formula broken down to the smallest proteins, tried gas drops, gripe water, apple juice, Karo, NOTHING HELPS. The pediatrician told us that we're just going to have to endure it until she outgrows it. 

I'm not going to lie to you all, or myself. I can't handle my daughter. A lot of the time I just cry. I hate this so much. All she does is cry. My partner works full time and I dont. I wasn't working during my pregnancy because I quit after my son died because I was so depressed, then came Covid, and then I was in too much pain to work. After I had her, I actually got a part time job just to get time away from my daughter. I quit it because it was actually overwhelming me to do both, and now I am starting a full time job so my partner can't make me feel like I should be the only one to handle her as well as cook, clean, do laundry, etc. 

I know how horrible it sounds, but I am at my limit. I love her but she stresses me out so much that sometimes I wish I never had her at all.

avocado198831,"New to the group! 

I gave birth to the most beautiful boy 7 months ago, I'm a first time mum. My pregnancy went well, I was low risk, and for the first time in ages I felt super relaxed, chilled, despite experiencing severe bleeding in the first trimester which thankfully wasn't anything to worry about, but stressful enough at the time. I felt like I did everything to be ready for the birth: prenatal yoga, NCT support group, hypnobirthing course, read lots, watched lost of videos, etc. I felt slightly petrified, but I felt ready. I'm usually a NIGHTMARE when it comes to health stuff as I have a history of health anxiety, but for some reason I felt the best I've ever been for years during the pregnancy. I just felt like things would be okay regardless of what happens. Then covid hit, thankfully my job enabled me to work from home from mid March onwards. Despite my health anxiety and the unknown about pregnancy and covid at the time, I remained calm (I was a teacher and so is my boyfriend so super high risk!), I dealt with it pretty well. I live abroad so my family had initially planned to come and rent a flat for a few weeks before/after the birth to help me. Obviously that didn't happen, I slowly came to the realisation that I would not have my mummy with me during what could be the worst pain of my life, but again, I was OK with it. Then my pet became severely ill and I was told a few days before the birth he would die shortly. I dealt with it. I was told my partner could only join me during active labour. It was shitty, but I thought I'd be OK. I had entire confidence in the medical staff to make sure this baby would be OK, and so would I. I felt confident.

So obviously I had to be the one with a shit birth. I laboured at home for three days, with quite severe pain during the night which would then go in the morning (typical). I was told I was in latent labour and to only come in to hospital when my contractions would be every 3 minutes, which is what I did. I had to spend the first five hours by myself in a room with no pain relief and to make it until 5/6cm by myself, as there was an emergency and they had to deal with this. I was left entirely by myself for an hour in a room when I was told it would take 5 minutes, in absolute agony, the worse pain of my life. I remember looking at the clock feeling like I was going to die and to just count every second. Finally I was told I could get an epidural and my boyfriend was allowed to join me, at 5am. The epidural obviously took 3 or 4 tries to work (I had a HUGE phobia of being paralised from it), but then it worked, I was chilled, I was fine, I was excited. I phoned my mum to let her know the baby would be any minute now, that I was fully dilated and ready to push, that baby was doing well and coping with the contractions, etc. The next time my mum heard from me, it was 9 hours later.

&amp;#x200B;

The baby sadly got distressed during the pushing phase. All I was told at the time is that his heart rate was dropping, but the midwife looked super calm and chilled so I wasn't worried. Then she told me a doctor would have to come in and check, the next minute I was told they would perform an episiotomy and use forceps, which I was fine with. They all looked so relaxed that I did not have a clue that potentially something bad was happening. The baby was born, I was told he was a boy, that he was absolutely fine, then all I remember is asking every second if my placenta was out yet lol. The placenta did come out, but I was told 'you have a severe tear, we need to take you to theatre'. Again, I thought 'well everyone pretty much tears, it will be OK'. 

So off we went to theatre with my partner and my baby as I was being stitched up for FOUR HOURS. It turned out I had a very , very rare internal tear which required multiple specialists to intervene. I was throwing up non stop from the drugs, was not looking at the baby at all, all I kept asking was if I was going to die. I didn't which is nice :)

The next few hours are a blur, my partner wasn't allowed to stay more than a few hours because of covid restrictions, so off I started being a new mum feeling super fucked up, not being able to walk because of the spinal, throwing up because I didn't have any food for 24 hours at this stage, with a brand new baby. I spent the next 48 hours like this and was told I had a 4th degree tear, that it was very very rare, and that I could develop a super rare complication but that they thought it would be fine as my surgery went so well. My partner had to whatsapp video call me during this time to be able to see his son. My mum had spent 9 hours wondering if I was OK stuck to her phone. I was genuinely, one of the worse times of my entire life. I just wanted to be home, fixed, starting my postpartum time with all the lovely products I had bought smelling of lavender and looking cute in my postpartum pyjams. 

Well guess who had the motherfucker super rare 0.1% of al deliveries it only happens in Africa complication !? Discovered 5 days post birth, an hour after the consultant at the hospital told me I was cleared and it healed up well. Hahahaha. I won't go into details about what my condition is as it genuinely is too gross and would be too traumatising for you guys to read.

Long story short, I was booked in for a stoma surgery 7 days post birth (so back to hospital  
), and was told an hour before getting that they made a mistake and I didn't need one. So I took my suitcase I had packed for a week worth of hospital stay, my brand new baby I was desperately trying to breastfeed, and off I went home, with a super rare, gross, painful condition that nobody seemed to know about. Thankfully I found a Facebook support group of women who have the same thing and that has been the only thing that kept me going and gave me hope that one day, I'll be fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember tears on the bathroom floor the first few days back at home, thinking this was my new normal. I could not walk properly, I didn't manage to sit down for 2 months, my boyfriend had to help me shower. My milk took 12 days to come in, I lost 15 kilos in 7 days, I managed to breastfeed but only lying down for two months.  I was, genuinely , completely fucked, but I was also the happiest mother on earth. I kept staring at my baby and thinking this was genuinely the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

I had dark thoughts one or two days, I'd say maybe 10 days post birth, where I was learning to deal with my condition, and where I remember thinking that my boyfriend and baby deserved and needed a partner and mum in good health and that I was too broken physically to be OK for them. I can't seem to remember directly thinking of taking my own life, but I remember being convinced that my life would be like this forever and that it was my new normal and that I could never ever function again. The thoughts passed quickly, I recognised they weren't healthy, I spoke to my therapist.

I was told at the hospital I would probably develop some sort of PTSD or post natal depression looking at the horrendous complications I suffered from. I was ready to face this.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole summer passed and no signs of PTSD , sadness, etc. I finally got to go home and see my family and I felt like I was dealing with my new condition better and better. I booked a surgery to get it fixed (in January), so I knew my life would get better and that I just had to deal with this in the meantime, I LOVED LOVED LOVED being a mum. I absolutely adored my baby, in fact I wasn't really able to leave it to anyone, even my mum, even for a couple of hours as I loved to be with him so much. My relationship was doing great, I was feeling chilled and relaxed, and I was amazed that my usual anxious personality was doing OK after all this. Everyone was telling me how proud they were of me after everything I had been through during a freakin pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Theeeeen...the cancer saga started. #cancergate. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started one afternoon. My partner had gone cycling for 4 days, and I was looking after the baby by myself for the very first time, I was absolutely petrified, but determined to make this a successful experience. I remember coming back from a walk in the park a beautiful sunny day. I listened to a podcast about miscarriage. It suddenly reminded me of my first trimester and how worried I was the bleeding would lead to miscarriage. For some reason, I felt completely triggered and my mood went from ' I feel so happy right now, I'm looking after my baby by myself and it's going great ' to 'I feel very very anxious and maybe I'm going to die and I won't see him growing up and he needs me to be healthy and OK'. Then this is when it all started. 

I stared at my breasts as I was boobfeeding and I thought my right breast looked odd. Breast cancer crossed my mind. I thought about it quite a bit for a few days, then brushed it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I saw this mole that I could not remember seeing before. I was genuinely convinced it was brand new, started to worry, then found some old pictures of me and saw it was there before. Relief, Phew.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I started experiencing extreme , easy tiredness during the day when my boyfriend came back to work. This corresponds to the moment my little one hit a 9 week old sleep regression of waking up 5/6 times a night, intense breastfeeding, etc, so I didn't worry too much. 

Then I felt like I started putting on weight, felt frequent urination, got tested negative for a UTI. Ovarian cancer was the first thing that lingered a bit too long for my liking. I was convinced my belly fat was ascites, and I remember not being able to fall asleep at night , googling and researching about ovarian cancer. I was fairly convinced there was at least a cyst and that it explained why I had such irregular periods before we conceived. I voiced all my concerns to my doctor, who offered to do the blood test to detect ovarian cancer, By the time it was time to do the blood test, all my symptoms had gone and I managed to rationalise and thought I did not suffer from ovarian cancer.

I stopped breastfeeding, little one started sleeping through the night, but the tiredness remained. One day, I noticed this HUGE purple bruise out of nowhere on my leg. Leukemia. Leukemiagate started, and this one remained on my mind until I had my blood work done, which came back completely normal but B12 deficient. I saw my therapist this day, who told me she was worried I did not look as relieved as I should be. I thought I was just tired and needed time to process and convince my brain I would be OK.

I started noticing that I was hungry every 2/3 hours, and that I actually felt like this for quite a while, blaming on on breastfeeding and sleep deprivation. I first thought it might be B12 deficiency, but I was told by my son's GP it was probably due to acidity in my stomach. He prescribed me omeprazole, told me there was probably not something to worry about, that maybe if it remained we'd check for an ulcer. Then obviously I went home convinced it was stomach cancer I ignored for months.

I could keep going, but today I am now convinced it is something to do with my bowels. I got over the stomach fear, my constant hunger has mysteriously disappeared- if anything, I actually don't even feel hungry. So I came from feeling constantly hungry for 3 months until three days ago, to now feeling like I'm not hungry at all. If I eat food, then I feel like it's nice and I devour the pizza.

I feel like my hunger is all over the place. So is my sleep- I wake up from a solid 8 hour night of sleep and I still feel sleepy for hours. But then in the evening I feel totally fine.

Obviously, everything points towards some sort of mental health / trauma thing. But I'm still convinced my mental health is fine, and that it's a health issue I am dealing with as I'm writing this very post.

michness,"I'm nearly 4 weeks postpartum. I upped my medication so I'm not nearly as anxious but I still feel like I'm bombing motherhood.

I'm worried I don't do enough skin to skin beyond breastfeeding. But she takes 45 minutes to eat and then usually passes out. We put her up in her crib in an attempt to build good sleep habits but I see pics of other moms snuggling during naps and wonder if I should do that.

I'm worried she doesn't sleep enough. She sometimes wakes up three times during her naps and is a pain to get down.

I'm worried I'm failing at breastfeeding. I have low supply so I sometimes have to supplement and I use a nipple shield because it hurt too much without one. I feel like I can't even feed her properly.

I just don't enjoy motherhood like I thought I would. I hate feeling this way. When she was born I wasn't filled with immediate unconditional love.

I finally accepted the fact I most likely have it, as it took awhile to realize. I bit the bullet, and started calling referrals for therapists. All waiting lists. I specifically said I’m suffering from PPD, which I thought would be pretty important, but now I’m just sitting and waiting. I also made an appointment with my general physician since he’s always been supportive and he may have an idea for possible medication - have to wait 2 weeks for the earliest possible appointment. Even the therapists that I’ve been put on a waiting list for don’t take insurance. Oh cool, now I’ll have to pay $100+ each appointment, out of pocket? That won’t add to my depression whatsoever! 

Just when I finally became brave and honest with myself, it’s all a waiting game. I want help NOW. I’ve been struggling for 8 weeks, and while I should have reached out earlier, I wasn’t ready to admit it to myself at that point. I don’t know. This just sucks all around. 

And you know, it makes me feel awful for moms that are struggling a lot worse than I am. Are they having to wait this long? Or longer?! It’s not right or moral.

Madhamsterz,"Hello everyone,

Bear with me I am using text to speech while pumping. I suddenly am aware that my mental health is really struggling. I was diagnosed as positive with coronavirus on Monday. It is assumed that both my baby and my partner had it as well. It was extremely stressful and led to a lot of sleep deprivation and stress around-the-clock. I am now on data and and I think physically I have come through the hardest part however mentally I am taking a dive.

In addition my baby has had issues with feeding and nursing the whole time. 1st the issue was that she fell asleep all the time period she was born at 37 weeks induced because I had high blood pressure. Later her issue was that she spit up everything said to her and I didn't quite yet know how to burp or sufficiently in wasn't using a proper bottle. But now the issue is that she will not directly breastfeed or if she does for not very long and she only wants to be bottle-fed. I find pumping exhausting and that I'm always running out of milk almost which is scary. Having coronavirus also made my milk stores go way down which was very scary. Trying to avoid going to formula to really stick it out with the breastfeeding. 

I find a feeling of anxiety when my partner tells me hes going to go to bed at night. I also feel anxiety when he leaves the house. Is no longer contagious and went to visit a friend who lost a family member.It just makes me anxious to be alone right now.

I speak sweetly to my baby and I try to stay calm but my emotions are really all over the place. Rationally I know that things can be temporary and that this is due to hormones and maybe illness but it is just a really sick feeling that is hard to just talk myself through like I usually can.

Being pregnant was one of the happiest times of my life. I generally struggle with anxiety and I found myself so happy and almost high the entire time... this concerned me because I know crashes come after highs.  I feel that crash right now.

Really stunk that I couldn't invite anyone over while I was sick to help me. Stinks that I can't go anywhere in this pandemic. I feel like I am in an alternate reality. The sleep deprivation is definitely a challenge even though my partner takes in the morning so I can sleep. 

I do see a therapist once a week already so I will talk to her about it but I feel like I need more than that .. what are the treatments? Do people go on drugs? 

Depression and anxiety run in my family and my father definitely has bipolar problems. For some reason I saw I might be spared but this is proving to be a challenge. 

I just want to know that it's temporary. 

Can anyone help?",Postpartum_Depression,Coronavirus Positive with 3 week old triggering major anxiety and depression.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/k30gxj/coronavirus_positive_with_3_week_old_triggering/,1606639399.0,2020-11-29 01:43:19,4.815317424133424e+18
missJMAR,"This is unbearable. And it’s a constant roller coaster of emotions. One minute I think I’ve accepted it, then I’m on the floor crying the next. 

I’ve suffered from Anxiety, Depression, and Panic Disorder since I was about 15 years old, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II about 3 years ago. Pre-pregnancy I was on four medications, and when I got pregnant, I cut it down to three because one of them wasn’t safe for the baby. It took me 6 years of actively seeking help with 5 different doctors to get my medicine combination just right. And it finally happened RIGHT BEFORE I got pregnant. I was on cloud nine and felt normal and like myself again for the first time in over a decade. Then.. I got pregnant. 

In 2016, we decided that we really wanted to start a family. I had an IUD, which I removed so that we could get pregnant. We tried for over a year also with no luck. Then we just stopped trying. This time around, I got off my birth control because my fiancé REALLY wanted to try (I didn’t.. I would get such bad anxiety every time after).. and of course, it only took ONE TIME. I think that’s one of the biggest factors. I didn’t want to get pregnant this time. I didn’t want a baby. I didn’t want my life to change or to make room for anyone else. But, I went with it because again, he wanted it, and I wanted my baby to know my parents, and I wanted my parents to enjoy my baby while they were still young. I thought it would all be okay by the time I delivered. 

Now, the exact thing I feared would happen did.. I’m mourning my former life.. which I loved and was so happy with. I feel trapped and the anxiety of it is like none I’ve ever known. It’s a constant feeling of deep, all encompassing terror. My stomach constantly aches, my head hurts, I’m numb, I haven’t eaten more than a few spoonfuls of food in the last couple of days, I haven’t showered or gotten up from my spot on the sofa other than to make formula, change a diaper, or if I have enough energy, to go to the bathroom. All I seem to do is sit staring off into space or just lay down and sleep.. I feel like my brain just shuts down so I don’t have to face the reality of any of this, which is so out of character for me. I’ve always been one to face things head on and confront any issues or difficult situations.

There’s no going back. There’s no amount of time that will pass that will undo this. It’s permanent. And I don’t know if that’s what scares me, or the fact that I’m still not ready to be a mom.. if that’s even what I want to begin with. It’s not about not having time for myself to do the things I want to do. I know I can ask people to watch her so that I can have time to myself.. but at the end of the day, she’s here. Forever. She exists. There’s no going back to just me by myself or just me and my parents or just me and my fiancé. I truly and wholeheartedly enjoyed it when it was just the four of us. I finally found the place in my life that I was in love with and could enjoy with a sane mind. Now, no matter how much time I spend away, she’s still there and I have to return to that life. There’s no more JUST ME time.

People that feel this way say that it has nothing to do with their baby, and sometimes I question the truth.. every time I look at her, I feel unconditional and pure love.. but I can’t help but also feel fear, despair, pain, sorrow, and sadness. I just find myself constantly returning to my past life in my mind and resenting this new one that was supposed to be rainbows and fairy dust and instant love, bonding, and connection with your new role as a mother and your baby. There’s even moments when I feel almost jealous of her.. that she has taken center stage in my life. But I don’t mean that in the way it sounds. I’m by no means being ignored or neglected by my parents or my fiancé. It just makes me all the more confused and frustrated. I have no idea what is going on in my head nor do I understand my feelings. 

I have an app that keeps track of the baby’s age, and when the last time they were fed, had their diaper changed, how long they’ve been sleeping, etc, and seeing the “11 days”.... I immediately think to myself... “it’s only been 11 days?!! Oh wait.. There’s only the REST OF MY LIFE left of this.” It feels like a life sentence in prison. Which is unbelievable to think that that thought is actually crossing my mind. Who thinks like that?? I hate myself. 

I had a really rough birth (but that’s another story) and I thought that the moment I heard her cry, everything I had feared and all the anguish I felt would disappear... it did not. Everything felt even more magnified. There was no excitement, no relief, nothing. Just fear. When I was in recovery and got to spend time with her, I felt a slight shift. I was happy and really excited to start my next chapter outside of the hospital with her. It’s only been 11 days,  but it’s been some ups, but mostly downs. 

Yesterday, I hit rock bottom. I fed and changed her diaper while my fiancé finally caught up on some sleep (he’s pulled literal all nighters since we’ve been home from the hospital to make this all easier on me).. and I looked at her and just cried and screamed internally.. asking why I allowed myself to get into this situation knowing I wasn’t ready yet. All I’ve been doing is crying and pleading as silently I can.. I really don’t know how I’m going to get past this... the deep waves of anguish and regret. And when I feel something in my gut... let’s just say I’ve learned not to go against it. And this time I did. I knew I shouldn’t have become a mother yet. I thought now would be the right time because of covid and being forced to stay home and because I’m 33 and time is running out. I thought 10 months would be enough time to get excited and feel ready for motherhood. It was not. 

Another reason I’m so devastated is because me and my fiancé have never been closer.. we have had a VERY rough relationship. A lot of it one sided at one time or another. But now, I’ve never felt so in love with him and all I want to do is spend all of my time with him and ONLY him. I want us to have all of our time to ourselves. It’s all because of how amazing he was with me in the hospital and what an amazing dad he already is and how he’s been taking care of me and our daughter... it’s a side of him I never knew existed. And I’m so sad that 8 1/2 years got away from us that should have been like this.

I just don’t know that this is really what I want.. and it’s too late to go back. It makes me physically sick. I love my daughter and I don’t don’t want to feel like I regret her or for her to ever know that I felt this way.. I’m just so mad at myself because I knew I didn’t want this yet and I went with it anyway.. because I’m a people pleaser... I’m always trying to make everyone else around me happy.. and now I’m stuck in this prison in my mind... and this poor little girl has to be involved in it. 

I really pray that I will get past this.. or I have no idea what will happen to me. I truly fear for my sanity and my future happiness/contentment. I’ve read about a lot of women who still regret becoming a mom and it’s been years. I’ve seen my friends with their children and I always thought to myself “thank god that’s not me” and how glad I was that I was ending and beginning each day the way I wanted to with the people I wanted to. The idea of motherhood never appealed to me. I always said “one day when I have kids..” but never REALLY thought it would ever happen.. and now here I am.

My cousin told me that in 3 months I’ll feel better. But 3 months feels like an eternity.. and that’s just the beginning. I just want to stop feeling this way. I want to turn back the clock and undo everything until I know that I’m ready. It’s beginning to affect everyone in my household. I can see that I’m hurting my parents and that my fiancé is doing EVERYTHING he can to hold it down for me and keep me strong. But eventually, it will take its toll on him too.. and I know I would FULLY lose it then if I let him down. I hate myself and my mind for feeling this way. And like I said.. there’s no undoing it, there’s no amount of time that will pass that will fix this “situation”... I can only sit in fear and confusion.. and it really scares me. 

I’m also concerned because this isn’t an easy fix like a physical ailment.. as I mentioned earlier, it took me 6 years to find the right combination of medications to feel better. And then I got pregnant. Now I have to start all over and there’s a new life involved. I’ve never been more afraid for my sanity than I am now. 

We had my fiancé’s parents over for thanksgiving, and at the end of the evening, it was my parents, his parents, baby, myself, and my fiancé, and I felt a little better. I don’t know if it’s the isolation of the pandemic that makes it a little more difficult, or what, but sitting in the house alone all day while the other people are catching up on sleep definitely doesn’t help. Even watching TV shows and movies, and listening to music that always made me feel better doesn’t help.. they’re actually triggers reminding me of my old life. 

Please don’t misunderstand me and think I hate my child... because that’s not it at all. My dad told me I’m not in this alone.. there’s three other people in this house that are here to help me.. but there could be 1000 and I’d still feel this way. I’m trying to think of another time I felt so trapped and scared... but I can’t for the life of me. And even if there was another time I felt this way... there was always a way out, a light at the end of the tunnel.

And I’m so sad that 8 years got away from us that should have been like this. I just don’t know that this is really what I want.. and it’s too late to go back. It makes me physically sick. I love my daughter and I don’t regret her.. I just regret that I may have gone into this too soon.. when I KNEW I didn’t want a baby yet.. I’m just so mad at myself because I knew I didn’t want this and I went with it anyway.. because I’m a people pleaser... I’m always trying to make everyone else around me happy.. and now I’m stuck in this prison in my mind... and this poor little girl has to be involved in it.. I really pray that I will get past this.. or I have no idea what will happen to me. 😢 And I’ve read about a lot of women who still regret becoming a mom and it’s been years. I’ve seen my friends with their children and I think to myself “thank god that’s not me”... and now here I am. My cousin told me that in 3 months I’ll feel better. But 3 months feels like an eternity.. and that’s just the beginning. I just want to stop feeling this way. I want to turn back the clock and undo everything until I know that I’m ready. I hate myself and my mind for feeling this way. And like I said.. there’s no undoing it, there’s no amount of time that will pass that will fix this “situation”... I can only sit in fear and regret.. and it really scares me. I feel terror and pain. I can’t eat and all I do is sleep.. I feel like my brain just shuts down so I don’t have to face the reality of any of this, which is so out of character for me. Every time she makes a little sound it sends me into a panic.. when it’s time to wake her to feed or change her diaper until the minute she goes back to sleep, I feel uncomfortable, scared, and like all I want to do is cry and run away. I’m also concerned because this isn’t an easy fix like a physical ailment.. it took me 6 years to find the right combination of medications to feel better. And then I got pregnant. 😭 Now I have to start all over and there’s a new life involved. I’ve never been more afraid for my sanity than I am now. Please don’t misunderstand me and think I hate my child... because that’s not it at all. My dad told me I’m not in this alone.. there’s three other people in this house that are here to help me.. but there could be 1000 and I’d still feel this way. I’m trying to think of another time I felt so trapped and scared... but I can’t for the life of me. And even if there was another time I felt this way... there was a way out.",Postpartum_Depression,Spiraling..

saltyhotwing,"(Baby is 7 weeks. On mobile and pasted from OneNote so sorry for formatting)

So I actually expected that I would get PPD when I was pregnant - I have a long history with depression, and PPD runs in the family, so I correctly anticipated that I would also experience it. What I didn’t anticipate is the guilt that I feel for being depressed. There are so many posts about PPD where the OP gets no breaks, no rest, no time away from baby, but I do. My husband is awesome. We take shifts at night, so I get a 5 hour stretch to myself (whether or not I sleep is a different story, but I do try). Plus I usually get a couple hours here and there during the day to take care of myself and do things I enjoy. Baby eats pumped milk and formula, and I’m weaning off of pumping because every time I have a let down I want to smash everything in sight and tear my skin off. So baby doesn’t count on me nursing to eat, meaning husband can fully care for him without me. Husband is a true partner and I’m so lucky to have him. 

Not to mention that I’m back to working from home while husband is off work for another 6 weeks (he gets a full 12 weeks paid parental leave while I got 6 weeks of short term disability at 60% pay for 4 of those weeks). I have the best job and the best boss ever - my hours are nearly 100% flexible, and my boss outright told me that I get to bill full time but I’m not going to have much on my plate so I can focus on baby and not be overwhelmed. I literally could not think of a better situation work-wise and husband-wise. 

But it’s like no matter how much time away from the baby I get, I’m always craving more, and I feel awful for it. I know that I love him because the thought of something happening to him is a horror I can barely contemplate. But where is this weird overwhelming love everyone talks about? I half expected fairy dust to swirl around me when I locked eyes with him for the first time. Right now I’m so unmotivated to do anything with him that sometimes I can barely look at him, let alone talk to him. It breaks my heart because he doesn’t deserve this. It’s not his fault, but he’s the one who’s going to suffer. He’s the one who’s going to have stunted development because I can’t bond with him. He’s the one who’s going to have a limited vocabulary because I can’t think of what to say to him and hardly talk to him. Eventually he’s going to be old enough to notice that sometimes Mom looks at him with dead eyes and a blank face and he won’t understand that it’s not his fault. 

 Thank god his dad is around because he at least gets one parent that he likes. Dad can soothe him and put him to bed with little issue, but he’s basically non stop fussy with me. Everyone warned me that he may not like his dad in the early months - not one person said he may not like me. 

I certainly can’t blame him. I feel like he’s going to grow up and resent me for having him when I so clearly wasn’t emotionally strong enough to handle having a child. What the hell was I thinking? This is exactly why I waited years to have a baby - I knew I wouldn’t be able to handle it. How did I forget that? 

And now I can’t take it back and there’s no good solution. Can’t end it because then he grows up without a mom and that sucks. Cant run away for the same reason, and also makes me the worlds biggest douche. So, what? He grows up with an emotionally unavailable mom? One who loves on him until he starts screaming and then breaks down almost immediately? I want so much for him to feel able to be open and honest with his feelings as he grows up, but how on earth is that gonna happen if I lose it every time he cries? At least when he finally cuts me out of his life for being a crap mom, we’ll both get some sleep, I guess. 

(FYI I have spoken to my OB about depression and she put me on a medication I used to be on, along with the two I was already taking.

beelove414,"Hello all, 

I am looking for some advice about my husband. A little backstory we have a 15-month-old daughter that was conceived via IVF. Also my father-in-law passed away this past February. We have both been out with Covid for the last three weeks and today was my first day back at work, I work 12 hour shifts so when I am gone, I am gone the entire day. 

When I came home today I could tell that my husband was not himself and not in a good mood and after pressing him, he expressed that he feels very depressed because he does not enjoy being a parent and he feels like he is a prisoner in the house and can’t go out and do anything with her due to covid and The fact that it’s just a hassle to leave the house. He also told me that he was frustrated that she did not eat well today and was throwing food (which she does all the time.) He said he feels like a failure as a parent because she’s never happy when he is taking care of her and only happy when I am home with her (not true). After speaking about this for a little while, he said that he is feeling very depressed because this was the first major holiday without his father and we did not get to spend it with the rest of his family due to us having Covid. I tried to get it out of him if he is just feeling depressed about his father or truly does not enjoy being a parent and he said he feels both. He also said that he can’t wait for 7 PM every day because he knows she will be going to sleep soon and he won’t have to worry about being a parent...

We have both felt that becoming a parent was not exactly what we envisioned but we are still enjoying our daughter. I asked him if he wanted to speak with someone and he said no. He said “I will get it together “   

Does anyone have any advice? I would like to help him because I have definitely had days where I feel this way but it’s not every day that I am waiting for bedtime and cannot wait for a break from her.

mmehukattii,"Idk if this is right place... i (20) was in hospital for a week after my water broke and my daughter was born 5 days later premature and she spent a month in nicu. it was extremely hard time. she has been at home for a month now and im so proud of her, shes growing well and is very lovely. But what makes that hard is that im married but i feel like i am a single mother taking care of her alone. it started already when she was in nicu. i spent my days there, i went early in morning and came back late in evening. he (26) visited there only few times and when he came he stayed like an hour. now that shes at home, im the only one taking care of her. he has fed her only 4 TIMES. he has never changed her diaper or gave her bath. i wake up at night to feed her. all he does is sometimes cuddle her amd other times he play playstation or spends out with friends (he literally disappears for hours) i try ask him if he could for example feed her once at night so i get few more hours more sleep, i think its reasonable since im the only one taking care of her and he stays up until morning anyway. but he always makes some reason why he cant. sometimes its 'im afraid' sometimes 'im tired' or whatever... one day i asked again if he could feed her at night once and he said no, this time reason was that its my job as a mom. we had a huge fight, first i tried say nicely about how i feel but he didnt react well. Also he had promised to me when we were trying to get pregnant that when baby comes he will help as much as he can. LIES.
theres literally days when hes at home with us and i ask if he could be with baby while i take shower. immediately he has something 'more important' to do. i have said its fine if he go oyt sometimes but he should also spend time with us, he said he doesnt want to be in prison.. funny how he gets all the free time but i cant even take a 10 minute shower alone or eat my food without holding baby. he is totally capable to do it too. he keeps telling me i need to be with baby all the time and care about her, he can clean home and cook. AGAIN LIES. i do it all with one hand while holding a crying baby with another. If i dont clean, our home looks like a fucking mess and he gets so angry. Im so fucking tired. I love him a lot but i feel like either he wasnt really ready for having kid or he regrets it. i have had moments when i think it would be better if i was alone. i have had moments when i start cry out of nowhere because im tired and frustrated. i have noticed i have started to think and say stuff like 'i wish i was dead so i could rest.""

BalboBibbins,"My kid#2 is 3 months old. I've been experiencing really overwhelming moments of anger. It's not brought on by any specific big thing, just seems to be a culmination of a ton of little (some not so little) things. I got sick this weekend, missed an event, broken down car, etc. I broke the door today because it was stuck and I was baby wearing and couldn't really fuss with it, so I just kicked it.  

I had PPD/PPA with my first, heavy on the A. I'm wondering if what I'm experiencing now could be the same bird with new feathers. I didn't have anger like this though. My main worry is to not be an a-hole to my first child. She's 4, and definitely triggering lately. She keeps asking for things, every minute, and cops a major attitude about everything. Can't blame her though, I couldn't open the door and broke it! 

I'm definitely feeling overwhelmed, unsupported, isolated. With the pandemic, I have my kids 24/7. Definitely eating some garbage and not getting enough exercise. The ground is fertile for some issues. 

Anybody else experience this, or even super different symptoms of PPD after multiple pregnancies?

emu222,"For back ground I have suffered from mental health in the past (depression, anxiety, panic disorder and PTSD) so I’m no stranger to the feeling of not feeling yourself. My OB and Midwife were great at making sure everything was going okay, and everything was during the pregnancy, and even the first couple months PP. 

LO is almost 5 months old, and I love them to absolute pieces, I really do, I am happy to be a mom. On the other hand they just started teething, so naps have basically been non existent. We co-sleep (don’t come for me, it has worked amazingly up until the teething) and now he’s waking up every 2 hours super fussy!

With all the restrictions in place I barely get out of the house as it is, but now no social gatherings at all, so I’m even more isolated. The more I’m stuck at home alone with this crying baby the more and more I start to resent the LO. I hear them cry and just look with absolute disgust, and let them cry a bit before snapping back to and going to care of them. 

On top of all that I then have so much guilt running through my mind about that and other things, that when I go to reach out to family or friends my guilt tells me not to because they will think I’m a terrible mom.

Katiebabes,"It's weird ya know. I ended up have kids 7 years apart. And with my first child I knew. Like. I really knew I had post partum depression. Hell was so bad her father cheated on me repeatedly because I wasn't me anymore. When she was 18 we found out I was pregnant again. But with complications and I lost that little baby at 7 and a half weeks.
 We separated when she was two when I finally had enough of the lies and the cheating. And I fell in love with an old friend from highschool. The 3rd year into our relationship. We found out there was only a 3% chance that I'd ever conceive without help. 
Two years later I had a miscarriage again at 12 and a half weeks. But that same year we were blessed to find out for Christmas I was pregnant again. And he immediately jumped into working so much harder picking up another job just so I didn't need to return to work right away knowing I was high risk. He did everything he could to make enough money for us. That baby is now almost a year and a half. And I still to this day don't feel like myself.

sadmom90,"I have a 13 month old and just when I think my mental health couldn’t get worse... it does. 

I have tried for over a year now to get help and I just get doors shut in my face because of doctors being unwilling to prescribe meds without an evaluation by a psychiatrist, but then getting (multiple) referrals and having each one say that they won’t treat breastfeeding mothers and it just feels like a slap in the face. My partner keeps telling me to seek help and I’ve tried and I honestly don’t think I can handle getting turned down again. I just can’t cope with that, I’m already beyond hopeless.

My baby doesn’t sleep, he’s hard to put down. He wants to nurse and then rock and rock and rock. I hate it, but also I hate sleep training even more and we tried it anyways only to have baby throw up from crying and he never ever lays down. He just keeps crying until eventually I nurse and rock and plead him to sleep. I asked my partner to take the lead on sleep training again recently, sent him the stuff and yet he never follows through. We all need sleep and at this point I’m so stressed about going back to work (as a nanny) and having my kid never sleep. I won’t have the time to spend 40+ minutes putting him down for a nap with another baby to take care of and I can’t neglect my duties to take care of my son like I can at home. I feel like it’s going to be an absolute shit show, yet everytime I tell my partner how stressed I am about going back to work, I’m met with just a “you can do it, you’ll be great.” And it’s just not what I need to hear.

It’s like that with everything too. I feel like he doesn’t even try to sympathize or make my life easier. I only ask of him to clean the kitchen at the end of the day and deal with garbage and recycling and put away the folded laundry. I do all the cooking and housework besides that. And it gets done maybe 50% of the time and it’s never actually clean. I still have to sweep and wipe down the counters and put away clutter. Am I really asking that much?? I’m sick of it and it makes me so angry that I see red. And I’m tired of being so angry. 

Back to my son not sleeping- my partner is so hard to wake up at night that when I ask for help after being up for hours with the baby, it can take him 10 minutes to wake up after having to shake him awake. And then he takes his sweet time to help and I’m literally in tears by the end of it. I want more than 2-3 hours of sleep and for him to not guilt trip me when I ask him to help at night. Last night I was at my breaking point when after I asked him to help, he brought the baby to nurse in bed and the baby kept pinching my nipples and I yelled at it. And I cried. And my partner just sat there saying nothing and not helping. I deal with the baby all day, and fight for it to sleep and nurse it all day, and at constantly being touched. I just want space at night at least and I don’t even get that.

I grabbed my keys and left at 1am but I didn’t know where to go so I just came back home, but I really just want to leave for good. I’m so fucking tired. I’m so angry. I’m so hopeless. And I just have to keep going with no help? I can’t see a way out or an end in sight unless I just kill myself. I want to die so badly. At the same time I don’t but I don’t see a way out. How am I supposed to go to work in two weeks when I’m barely making it through the day with one baby. And then I’ll come home to my own messy house and have to clean that by myself before bed and then still not get a break when my baby needs me all night.

beawax,"I don’t know if it’s PPD or if it’s just me but does anyone else ever feel like their best years are behind them? 

From age 17-22 I was in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic asshole. Because of this I spent my years cooped up in a tiny bedroom, and never really ventured farther from that. Sure he would take me to bars but I never got the thrill of flirting with random strangers or being hit on(until I turned 22 I was overweight, I spent that whole year losing over 100lbs). He never made me feel special, pretty, or wanted. The whole relationship he belittled me, compared me to other women, and generally just put me down for whatever reason he could find. 

I finally smartened up and got out... I got my first well paying job(well enough that I could leave and survive on my own) but I immediately met the love of my life. I don’t regret this. He’s an absolute dream and no matter how down I get I will never ever regret meeting him. But, not even a year into our relationship I got pregnant. We were both thrilled and 9 months later we had our beautiful son. But now at 24 I feel... full of regret? I don’t know how to look forward to my future. I suppose because I don’t know what I’m looking forward to? I feel that my most attractive years are behind me(society says this is age 18-21), I didn’t go to college, I didn’t travel, I didn’t make any memories. I guess I turned out to be the thing I feared the most- completely unspectacular and incredibly average. I now have a saggy mom bod, and even *if* I can lose my pregnancy weight gained I still won’t feel attractive... I’ll still be saggy and approaching my 30’s, which as we all know as women is when society starts to view us as trolls (please note when I was 18 all I looked forward to was being 30 and successful so I definitely don’t share this sentiment lol). I won’t have a career. I won’t be able to travel because my job now is to be a mom. Unfortunately I’m disabled so I always had two choices- pursue a life of fun and whimsy or be a mom. In the moment I chose to be a mom and I love my son, but I can’t help feeling sad about the loss of the potential of my old life? I don’t know how to explain it. I wish I hadn’t wasted my young years with an abusive asshole who tore me down and kept me at home. I wish I’d gone out, flirted around, slept around, felt what it feels like to be wanted by someone. I wish I’d made cool stories and memories. I don’t have anything exciting to tell my son about me. My parents used to tell me about all the cool things they did before I was born. I don’t know. I guess I just wish I could tell 17 year old me not to go anywhere near that guy. I wish I’d told myself to go out on adventures, see the world, make friends, make memories, explore hobbies, interests and passions, flirt around, sleep around, whatever.... instead I spent it sad, abused, and lonely, in a tiny bedroom with nothing to look forward to except one day finding the courage to leave and start my life. Now my most attractive years are behind me. My best years are behind me. My chance of having a fun and wild youth is gone. Sure I could do these things 20 years from now but... does anyone have experience with this? Is it just as fun? Every 40 year old woman I’ve met just complains about how old they feel and look and make comments about how all I have to look forward to is incontinence, a husband that won’t touch them or spend time with them anymore, kids that don’t call, and honestly they just sound miserable as all hell. 

Please tell me there’s something to look forward to; that my best years aren’t behind me... and that I’m not alone in feeling this way.

I talked to my husband and vented that out. He was understanding, and a loving father to our twins. But sometimes I break down, and asking myself why do I feel like this. There were tired nights that I just needed sleep but a heavy heart keeps me awake at night. And then I rush myself to the bathroom and just sob.

I dialed it back and fed her more instead, that calmed her down, and then I continued the burping and she's fine but I cried.

S0lac3_of_the_m1nD,"Mental health is declining

I have a beautiful 15 month old son. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
I had to quit my job due to the whole COVID mess, in order to provide full time care for my son, as we lost the care we had. I have to give the highest respect to stay at home parents. 

My days consist of doing all the cleaning, all the cooking, raising my son, teaching him. There is nothing else...my fiancé works full time, partially at home. I have never felt so alone in my entire life. I never  go out because of COVID. Never. Whenever i talk to my fiancé about needing to go out, to have a break by myself (to see one friend, masked, with social distance), he always brings up the what if’s, and how it is a risk and our son could get sick. So I stay, out of fear that what IF my son gets sick? He and I both would blame me. 

I think that I may have some form of depression. I feel like I’m just surviving. Just trying to get through each day, raising my son the best i can. I feel like there is just zero romance from my fiancé. I am very affectionate, I remind him often how much I love him, what i love about him, how handsome he is etc etc. but i get nothing. Once in a great while he calls me pretty. I’ve asked him if he could plan something romantic for us, and he always forgets. I asked for the 4th time this past two months and he said he needed help thinking of something... 
i also don’t feel appreciated. More often he has comments about when I have a hard day with my son and I’m so exhausted by the end of it I just say that my son has been a tiny bit of a butthole. The more recent comment being “I wonder where he gets that from”. 

I have no job. I have no money. I have no insurance. I want to try therapy but there is just no way without insurance or income. I can’t even know if I do have depression , and if so, what can be done... all I do is live for my son. 

I’ve still not lost the remaining baby weight and i just hate my body. I just want to feel loved and beautiful and appreciated. My fiancé likes plenty of pictures of other women that are sexy but where are my compliments or anything at all?

I don’t know what posting this will do.. it just felt good to finally say (or write) this out loud.

I don’t really have any other family and neither does my husband. We are both trapped at home, working remotely. I am thankful that we have our jobs, but it is incredibly isolating and stressful. My husband’s job doesn’t care that I work or that we need to take turns dealing with the baby (now 9 months) during the day. He’s up until 3-4 AM every day trying to catch up on work. I have selfishly been putting my work first because every time I receive an email, it triggers me and sends me into an angry spiral. Baby can’t be put down for more than 5 minutes without crying. I’m at the point where I just put her into her crib to let her cry because her crying triggers me and I have shit to do. We don’t have any help or support system. I have a younger sister, but she works and also does not feel comfortable watching children. My husband is on his final warning and is expected to be seated at his computer for his entire 8.5 hour long shift. They are now monitoring his computer to ensure this is taken place.

shelbylou939217,"I feel like my PPD has ruined my relationship with my baby (3 w, 5 d old). 

It's especially obvious since my mom came to help us out. With her or my husband, he's very calm and content. He was awake and chilling with my mom this morning and when I tried to hold him, he instantly started fussing and crying. My mom tells me to not get ""frustrated"" and ""stay calm"" since he can pick up on that but it's not exactly like I can turn my emotions off. 

And I'm not frustrated. I'm heartbroken that my baby doesn't like or love me. He smiled a real smile at my mom first. And smiles at her a lot. He barely smiles for me. I feel guilty for not being able to turn off my emotions or switch them to more positive ones when I hold him or interact with him because I feel like if I could do that, we'd be able to bond and he'd love me. 

When I come into the room and say something my mom and husband will be like, ""Oh look, he's looking for his mommy!"" Which I just feel is bullshit they say to try to make me feel better and encourage me to come hold him. 

I feel like it's all my fault. I've had PPD pretty much since we came home from the hospital and I'm sure that's affected our ability to bond with each other. And I misread his signals a lot so he gets really upset while I try to figure out what he needs/wants. 

And then when my mom came, I was so desperate to get some sleep and to get a break, I let her take over A LOT of the baby care I normally do during the day. So, I got what I wanted I guess. He wants nothing to do with me now. 

I just don't know what to do. My mom leaves on Sunday and then my son is gonna be stuck with his mom that he doesn't even like/recognize all day. I already have thoughts of how much better my son and husband would be without me and this just really seems to cement that. But I can't kill myself because there's a few people who would be sad and I feel guilty about that. 

So I feel trapped in limbo. I can't escape and now my son is stuck with me and my inability to have us bond with each other is probably going to give him reactive attachment disorder or some other attachment issue.

Two weeks ago my daughter was born, so now I should be feeling myself as a proud and happy father... Instead I feel like a complete mess, who’s life now revolves around changing diapers, listening to crying, and dealing with constant sleep deprivation. I knew that having a child would be challenging, but I have never thought that it would be so hard. Also when I see my daughter, I don’t feel any happiness at all, just all the problems that ruin our lives with my wife, and for this I feel like a piece of trash.
If I knew beforehand that having a child would be so damn hard, I would probably decided not to have one. But I can’t turn back now and the problem is that I am constantly breaking down and crying and I feel the only solution to end this suffering is to end my life... Everything would be so much easier that way.

I was visiting therapy regularly, I was prescribed with 20 mg Lexapro daily. It helped me return to my normal self.

Responsible-Floor946,"As the title says, I am 5 weeks PP. The first couple weeks I felt amazing, didn’t feel like I even had a baby! I was happy and just felt so free. The PPD slowly creeped up on me and I think each day I started to decline. 

The last few weeks I have definitely not felt like myself. It’s really affecting my relationship with my boyfriend, so much to where we just about broke up. I’ve been really irritable, quick to get mad, taking things too seriously, and my boyfriend said he’s noticed that I don’t put effort into things I used to, such as getting up and making breakfast or any meal, and that I don’t eat... I started taking fat burner pills and I never have an appetite. I could go all day without eating, and I’ll take my fat burner and then go to the gym and still not eat even after that. 

On another note, it’s been really hard the last few weeks cause not only am I struggling with all that, but I just feel like my boyfriend isn’t supportive enough. He just acts like he doesn’t give a crap anything and he doesn’t like to talk about things. I was sitting there trying to have a serious talk about our relationship and I’m balling my eyes out and he just sits there on his game and says “you expect me to drop everything I’m doing for you?” And I go, “well when I’m sitting here crying my eyes out and trying to talk to you, yeah you should put me before a stupid video game.” He eventually put his headphones on and turned the volume up so high that I could hear it. That hurt really bad. 

Alas, I’ve been in denial of having PPD cause I don’t want to go to counseling or go on antidepressants. I’m worried they will make me feel “blah”. I’m honestly really lost and I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I’m just looking for some advice and reassurance.

Glass-Cable2355,"So I'm just going to cut to the chase. Two and a half months before my wife gave birth, she told me that for the last month she was feeling disassociated and feeling like nothing was real. She told me she had been having a month long affair. I forgave her and we've been in the process of working on healing and our marriage. She's had weird and off days where's she's seemingly rebounded and texted the guy or run away from home. 

To give a little backstory, we had a miscarriage, got pregnant again, and then went into COVID lockdowns. Everything was and has been getting better slowly but surely. We've had lots of very hard days and lots of very good days, but slowly things have been feeling better and better. After much battle and debate I finally got my wife to talk to her OB about her depression and she was prescribed Zoloft. Things continued to be back and forth rough days/good days, but one thing I could always count on was that during at least all the good days, she assured me that she wanted to work on our marriage and be together.

Fast forward to post birth and things slowly started going down hill. Our baby is nearly a month old now and every day has been a little bit more concerning than the last as far as her mental health goes. I found alcohol in her handbag. She had picked it up after her postpartum appointment at the OB because she said she was just feeling so broken. The OB upped her zoloft from 50 to 100

A few days ago we went out on the town after leaving our two little critters with my family. We had a wonderful time, some alcohol was involved but not much and we have plenty of milk reserve for baby. We came home and her phone alarm was going off. I turned off her alarm for her since she was out of the room, and her phone was open to a conversation between her and the guy. The texts were just a lot of ""I'm not going to talk to you,"" ""well I'm not going to talk to you either, I've just been getting a lot of private calls and was wondering if you kept calling me,"" etc. 

I showed her the screen and it was like a light switch flipped. She started hollering, screaming, calling me names, telling me she didn't want to be with me anymore. It was out of nowhere. She was semi under the influence. But I feel like my light at the end of the tunnel is gone. She no longer wants to be married to me or so she says. She left that night saying she was going to go meet the guy. She came back and said she hadn't, she had just said that to hurt me and has since apologized. 

I'm just at a loss. She just closes up at any talk of emotion or any hard conversations and is slowly becoming harder and harder to get to open up. We have a counseling appointment and I'm trying to get her to agree to seek therapy and to talk to her OB again but she's very against it at the moment. Could any of her new behavior be attributed to postpartum/increase in anti depressants? I just need help.

foreveryoung94,"I had my first baby in July. A healthy little girl. With her best interest in mind, I made the difficult choice to do an open adoption. I want her to have the absolute best in life and I know I cannot provide that to her right now. I get to see her whenever I request, which has been every couple of weeks. 

I am 26 and already struggled with depression. Her father and I are not together, we broke up shortly before I found out I was pregnant. He has been involved and visits her with me.

I went back to work full time exactly two months after giving birth. I now do not think I was ready but I had an amazing job opportunity that I couldn’t pass up. I am responsible for all the bills and am completely exhausted. 
I feel the lowest I’ve felt since I lost my mom in 2013. Some days I feel okay and some, like tonight, I feel completely lost. I have random breakdowns and just want to give up. I don’t have her with me and I miss her every single day.

I haven’t seen a doctor since her birth due to insurance. However, my new insurance should be taking place soon. I tried a few counselors, but none had experience with adoption or postpartum depression and weren’t exactly helpful.

InTheTreeMusic,"So, this isn't my first bout with PPD, or even the worst. But it's 100%making me hate my partner, and sometimes my baby.

Baby is almost 12 weeks old. She should be less fussy. But she literally cannot be set down without crying. Sometimes I will get 5 minutes, maybe once a day. But usually it's instantaneous. So I wear her a lot, which doesn't completely solve the problem, but at least she's *less* fussy. We also cosleep. So I have 23 hours a day where I am holding her. It's driving me insane.

My partner has a range of mental health stuff of his own to deal with, and his anxiety makes him critical at the best of times. He's having a hard time dealing with baby as well, though he doesn't really say so. But he's holed up in our room most of the weekend (to be fair I have four older children, two of which he doesn't get along with at all). It's a lot when we also have a 2 year old and a newborn together.

The being absent is whatever. It irritated me at first that I cook 50% of dinners, do the dishes every night, do everyone's laundry (to be fair, I only sometimes do his), etc etc. He does take the trash out some of the time too. But I know he's having a hard time so I can pick up the slack.

But when he does come out, he constantly picks at my daughter (4) for *everything*. She's got some form of ADHD, she's hard to deal with, I get it, but it's *constant*. I feel like she can't breathe without irritating him in some way.

Then there's me. When the big kids aren't home he follows me around like a puppy. I'm trying to care for two children, one who *will not stop crying* but god forbid I don't act enthused aboht the cute puppy gif on reddit when he's shown me 20 in the past 10 minutes. Usually when I'm trying to do the dishes while wearing baby.

Every once in awhile, maybe every 3 or 4 days, there will be a magical moment when all the kids will be asleep and even baby will let me set her down in the swing and I might have 10 minutes of time for me. Then he wants to have sex. Don't get me wrong, I like sex, but there's a laundry list of things I would rather do with that time and *none* of it involves touching another person.

I love him. He's really not a bad guy and has largely been a good parent to our 2 year old, though he's always been less involved then me. I think me being responsible for my older kids kind of set that dynamic. But not I just find myself so *angry* at him.

Idkausername111,"I am 6 weeks PP and everything my partner does makes me want to scream at him. 

I am currently on maternity leave so I am with our daughter 24/7, he works every weekday. When he gets home he usually goes and piddles in his man cave or hunts until dark. He will take a shower and eat supper and finally take her so I can at least take a shower and then he goes to bed shortly after. 

When he gets home he asks me “what did you do today?” As if keeping our daughter alive isn’t enough. I try to clean as much as I can, but she just will not stay asleep once I put her down. I try my very best to get things done, today I made the bed, took the trash out, organized the bathroom closet, and did her laundry. It’s all I could do because she kept waking up crying anytime I would start something productive, and it took every ounce of energy I had to do these simple tasks. 

Any time I ask him to take her or do something for me he acts like it’s the end of the world or it’s not important. He takes so long to even register that I asked a question most of the time I will just get up and do it myself, but I just want to yell at him for it. At night he sleeps like a rock and makes noises in his sleep, he puts his arm on me and I just want to break it. 

I see now why people break up after they have a child. I know a lot of it is my fault because I feel as if I know best about what she wants and needs so if he isn’t doing something the way I like it I take over. But half of the time he just doesn’t do anything.

b3ani3s__mama_939,"I had undiagnosed PPA with my first 5years ago. But now I'm on Sertraline since 28w gestation with this baby who is now 12w old. 

No anxiety like before but now I hate spending time my older daughter ? I feel like she is just so annoying. Everything she does gets on my nerves. All her favorite shows and youtube videos make me crazy. She won't play on her own so constantly complaibg that she's bored. She's so bossy when I try to play with her that I just get angry and say I'm wasting my time, like its her way or the highway with play. If I try to set up an activity for both of us she just whines about how she wants to do something else. I just want her out of the house all the time. She gets so mad at the baby because I ""have to spend so much time with her"". But if I try to set aside time for just the two of us it's NEVER ENOUGH. No matter how much of myself I'm peeling away to give to her she needs MORE. I spent almost TWO HOURS with her this morning snuggling, playing a video game together and talking, then I poured her a bath and gave her a bath bomb, but she hates being alone in any room so she's throwing a fit about how she wants me in the tiny ass bathroom with her. But the baby is now awake and I need to feed her and then pump and keep her happy now, and I still have a boatload of dishes to do and laundry to fold and halloween costumes to finish sewing and I've got a needy baby and an even needier 5yo!!! UGH! She wasn't like this (or I wasn't like this?) Until the baby was born. Now suddenly she's needy AF and can't seem to do anything by herself.

I sent her to grandmas house yesterday at lunch time and just said like I need a break take her as long as you want. She loves grandmas house. Hubs was home for a few hours before finally asking if I was going to pick her up and I said no. Not yet. I'll wait until bedtime or when grandma wants me to. He asked ""don't you miss her?"" And I snapped ""nope. Not at all. Everything I do is constantly being criticized by her (anything fun, anything for baby) or being undone by her (cleaning, tidying, she's a fucking tornado, then complains if I pick up after her). So nope. Don't miss her"". He said that was rude. And I agree. I don't want her to know that I so sorely enjoy her being GONE! But I feel like my level of ducks about her feelings is dwindling every day because I hate spending time with her. I almost want her to hate me so she'll leave me the fuck alone.

I'm TERRIFIED of schools closing again because those 2 or 3 days a week without her are the only time I feel like I can breathe. I seriously don't mind anything with the baby, the baby is a baby, her needs are needs and she cries when something is wrong not just because she's a little bitch like big sis. 

Ugh. I know she's just a sweet 5yo who wants her mommy all to herself but I just can't 😭

Markimariee,"My husband thinks my PPD, PPA &amp; PPR are all in my head. When I’m upset and tell him I’m feeling suicidal he reciprocates my behavior, I.e. being mean to me, ignoring me, having an attitude although I CANNOT help it and have explained this many times. That all being said I sleep trained my 6 MO through Ferber method. My husband and I were in a huge fight last night bc I had a mental breakdown and told him I felt suicidal and he hung up on me (sorry for going on and on). Today I tried to be the bigger person and just move on because I was feeling better. So the Ferber method says to let your child CIO over extended periods of time as days go on. I sleep trained her, by myself because he basically doesn’t know what to do with her, and tonight while she was crying before her 15 min period was up he was going into her room. I said “please don’t go in there, I have a timer set.” One minute went by and he went into her room. She is not supposed to be picked up unless she is being fed the two times a night I have trained her for. So now the entire night I will be the one dealing with her constantly waking up and thinking she gets picked up and trying to soothe her because her entire routine is thrown off. Am I wrong to be mad? I’m currently in the bathroom crying I’m so upset. I know it’s minuscule, but I worked SO hard to sleep train her, it took half a month, just me doing it. And now he went and fucked it all up because he can’t just listen to me or communicate with me. He just thinks I’m “controlling” and “don’t let him parent” when all he had to do was listen to my directions and I would have GLADLY let him in there. Can someone please tell me if I’m in the wrong?

randomxfox,"My daughter is 3 months now. Before having her I was terrified of being a bad mom who's depressed or crying all the time. I started therapy but my therapist stopped seeing medicaid patients two months before I gave birth and I have yet to find another one. 

I absolutely love my daughter and she brings such joy to my life. I've never been happier but I've also never been so confusingly stressed. For the first 8 weeks I cried almost every day because I couldn't make enough milk no matter what I tried. After the 8 weeks I accepted I could only make half what she needs and that it was good I could make anything. I started crying less and I even finally got her into her cloth diapers and am loving them but every now and then I'm overwhelmed with the feeling of being a horrible mom. I don't even know why half the time. And I can't help but cry so much when it happens. 

My mom cried in front of me all the time since as long as I can remember. It always made me stressed because she also taught me you can never cry in front of anyone and everyone will think of you badly for it. I love my mom but it was really stressful. I'm now afraid of crying too much infront of my daughter because of it. I don't want her to have to deal with that stess.

saynotolove_,"So here is me. 2 weeks after giving birth to my son.
I left him with his father and went to Watson Bay for the afternoon. (I live in Sydney, that's a train ride and a ferry away.) I was suffering from severe postnatal depression. I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to admit to it to my doc even. Yet. I had my sister here then and had a good excuse to go out. And so I did. Packed for the day. Prepped for the bub. Kissed the bub and husband good bye. And just went. 

Mothers might gasp in horror and/or shake their heads in judgement.But I have learned the hard way that self care comes from within. I needed to be out. I needed to breathe. I needed to change out of my grubby maternity clothing and comb my hair and go out. I was in constant pain from the c section. I was in pain from the milk. I was depressed, stuck at home with a 2 hour schedule. The world didn't stop for me while I readjusted myself, realigned myself for this human being that now depended on me, so I was angry too. I went away for a day. And you know what miracle happened? Both men at home survived JUST fine. 

So mothers, don't let fathers babysit. Let them be fathers. Let them parent. And before long you will know how wonderful it is to have two people raise a child.

Lost_in_my_Mind98,"I'm pretty sure my husband is suffering from PPD or post-natal, whichever you want to call it. My son is 7wks old, and 2 weeks ago my husband had a major breakdown. He wasn't sleeping as well anymore because of the baby, and the lack of sleep made him dread going to work in the mornings, and he took out his anger frequently with his words towards our son and I. Which I understand, I can't say I haven't yelled because the baby wouldn't stop crying etc. Anyway, he got to the point where he stopped going to work, he called in for a week straight (which would be somewhat fine if I wasn't an unemployed stay at home mom). His mood was worse day by day. One day we got into an argument because he thought I wasn't doing enough, I thought he wasn't doing enough etc. He yelled, broke the wooden dog gate out of anger. Then he took his belt and locked himself in the bathroom. I saw the shadow under the door of him sitting on the floor against the door. I couldn't believe what he was trying to do. I yelled and banged on the door, threatened to get the neighbor to come break it down and call the police if he didn't open the door. After being silent for a minute, he did finally yell at me to leave him alone. At least I knew he was still alive. I managed to unlock the door from the outside and open it a few inches, and I demanded he give me the belt. I got ahold of part of it eventually, but he would not let it go, and we basically played tug of war for a minute before I finally stuck my leg in and kicked at him to get him to let go of the belt. I finally got it, and threw it in the trash. I had to call his mom to come for back up, she is good at talking people down, and he will listen to her over me usually anyway. Plus I had to take care of our son who was crying at this point from hearing us yelling/struggling. Not the life/examples I want to set for my son, thankfully he is still very young and may not remember. While waiting for his mom to arrive he did try to leave the house on foot (I took the car keys because he said he would drive into the lake), and he didn't have his new phone yet (he threw it against the wall and broke it earlier that week) so I wouldn't have known where he was. I threatened to make a big scene in the front yard to our neighbors if he tried to leave. Mom gets there finally (she's a 30 minute drive from us) and sits with him a few hours and they talk about random whatever until he is calm and feels slightly better. Next day he says he doesn't want to go back to work until we go on some sort of vacation. So eventually I give in, and make preparations for us to go to the beach and stay in a hotel. The beach is 5 hours away from us. He seems okay the first day, he plays in the waves at the beach for hours, all the while I'm on the beach in the shade with the baby, taking care of him. Next day doesn't go so well, he has 3 really strong long island iced teas, he said he thought he could handle it, he could not. Sun was going down, was getting cold, and I wanted to go back to hotel. He said he would need at least 3 more hours before he was okay to drive, I didn't want to wait that long. I have severe anxiety about driving, I have a permit but I never drive. But I didn't have a choice, and thankfully the hotel was only 10 minutes drive away. He gets in the back with the baby, and I'm in the driver seat trying to stop worrying, trying to get myself to just go. He yells at me more and more to just go, just go. Which doesn't make me want to go, it makes me freeze up. Eventually I let more people leave the parking lot before I finally back out and go. Whole time, I'm shaking and feel sick to my stomach with anxiety, following the GPS back to hotel, trying to stay in the lines because its dark and my eyesight is worse at night. He is still yelling, then he starts sobbing and saying he doesn't want to live because all he is going to do is work until he dies and never do anything fulfilling, etc. I just try to tell him it's okay, we will be okay. He keeps sobbing, saying nothing matters, and I tell him to think of our son, and live for him. We finally get to the hotel, he says he planned getting drunk so I would be forced to drive (I think it's only partially true). I make him take his shower first, he is drunk off his ass, falls in the shower etc. He finally gets out, I have to help him with getting dressed while he is mumbling random nonsense. He then lays on the floor, rolls around and starts acting like he is going to vomit. I ignore him for like 10 minutes so I can give the baby a bath in the sink,  feed him, and get him ready for bed. Baby is finally down, and I'm trying to roll husband on his side (still on the floor) so he doesn't choke on his vomit if he does throw up. He spits up a lot of drool, and pieces of the pizza he didn't ever swallow that he tried to eat while I was bathing baby. I tell him I will get someone to come in here and roll him over if he doesn't listen to me. He eventually sobers up enough to stop slobbering, and start watching south park on the tv. The rest of that trip was just super stressful for me, and it did not feel like a vacation for me at all, I even ended up losing my phone the last day at the aquarium, which he berated me for like I did it on purpose. ANYWAY, sorry for the huge word dump. He did finally go back to work, and he isn't trying to actively kill himself anymore, but he is absent towards our son when he comes home from work. He doesn't want to feed him, change diapers, barely holds him. But he does love him. And I'm over here struggling with my own anxiety and slight depression, but I put it all on the back burner because I have my baby and my adult baby to take care of. He doesn't want to go to his counselor, I don't know how to help him. Nobody needs to even reply back to me, I just really needed to get this off my chest.  But I will read your replies if you do.

I suffer from anxiety when I’m not postpartum. And this is a first for me with my third baby to have my mental issues intensified. 

The worry was creeping up. Getting more intense everyday. And then yesterday morning I woke up positive that she was dead. She looked lifeless as she slept so I panicked and picked her up desperate for her to move. She did. She opened her eyes and smiled the biggest good morning Mama smile. 

Then this morning the same thing. I woke up again. More certain today than I was yesterday that she was dead. This time I scooped her up and she was limp. I jousled her a little and yelled for my husband. And she woke up and gave me that same sweet good morning smile. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. She shows no signs of lack of oxygen. She’s pink and chubby and breathing fine not laboured. I know it was my own anxiety that caused these episodes. I know. I know? Has anyone ever heard of something like this? I still feel like something must be wrong. What if it wasn’t my anxiety. What if I saved her life 2 mornings in a row.

butlermommy,"I thought I was doing good after I gave birth, but I’m 14 weeks postpartum and all I do is cry all night worried about my baby (he is perfectly healthy but every fear overwhelmes me). During the day, my husband will do or not do one little action and I’m screaming. Flying off the handle really. I mention past mistakes (he made some serious mistakes at the beginning of our marriage) and I just say things that I would never say. I’ve told him I want a divorce (I really don’t), the words fly out and I can’t stop them during these meltdowns. I can’t afford a therapist at this moment, I’m with the baby all week while my husband works and then I’m working all weekend so I can pay off what our insurance didn’t cover while giving birth.

7789write,"Hi - I'm a Dad and I recently wrote and shared some of my thoughts on male postpartum depression - which seems to me a staggeringly under-research area of medicine. As a father, I really struggled with the first six months of my child's life and now see that I was not at all well during that time. Part of my blog, but part of my question overall, is do you think we struggle to define male PPD because as a society we're still unclear on what healthy fatherhood actually looks like?

ilikemycrazy,"I’ve been having some issues. Like I can’t sleep even when the baby sleeps. My anxiety is too bad. I don’t trust anyone to watch her long enough for me to get a nap. I won’t even let my mom watch my oldest because my anxiety has gotten that much worse. It’s like it’s impossible to relax. 

I’m so extremely sad and not bonding with her. With my first the bond was instant. I had to have an emergency c section due to baby’s heart rate dropping. It’s so different this time. My husband doesn’t really know what to do with her so I’ve been the only one really taking care of her. I feel crazy. My thought process and memory is gone. I have no motivation to move off of the couch.

I finally got the balls to tell my husband about all of this last night. His reaction completely caught me off guard. He knows I have a doctor appointment Thursday and he said I just sound like I’m a drug seeker wanting pills. That wasn’t my intention at all. I really just needed someone to talk to. And I thought I could tell him anything. But instead he completely invalidated all of my feelings.

hey3276,"**TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!**

I was diagnosed with severe postpartum depression &amp; PTSD about 7 weeks ago. I gave birth 9 weeks ago. The PTSD is from a traumatic delivery of my twins. I didnt realize my water had broken two days before I went to the hospital because I was already taking a shower when it broke. So I didnt go in then. I didnt decide to go to L&amp;D until two days went by because I was having pretty bad contractions but I squatted down to pick my phone up off the floor and I had a big gush of water come out. That's when i thought my water had broken but that was just the last little bit. **Once I arrived at the hospital they realized I was 6cm dilated. They tried to hook the heart monitors up to monitor the twins heart rates and that's when nurses went into panic mode and scared me to death. Baby Bs heart rate was dropping tremendously and with every contraction I had it for worse. The doctor runs in the room and if I had not have been at 9cm and ready to push I was going for an emergency csection. Baby A came out first and fast because that doctor pretty much reached her arm up me and snatched him out. She was so mean. But they were rushing to get baby b out because his heart rate was dropping badly. The doctor didn't tell me anything she was doing and she took the vacuum and pretty much ripped my second baby out. WELL when he came out he was lethargic and not breathing much and the doctor acted like she hadn't done anything wrong.

Well....my sweet tiny baby b which I named Haven River died four minutes after he was born. The autopsy proved he died from trauma to his head from vacuum and his heart gave out. My baby A which is Levi Stone was and still is a healthy baby boy. So yeah that's why I have PTSD. 
All around the same time my children's father left me  3 days after I gave birth because I couldn't get over his death. IT WAS ONLY 3 DAYS AFTER I WENT THROUGH IT AND 3 DAYS SINCE MY SON DIED BUT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER IT. I was so alone and had no family or really any friends to be there for me. I had a 2 year old toddler and a newborn to fully take care of alone and had to grieve the loss of my child at the same time. 

Long story short is I haven't been able to go back to work yet since the birth because it's been hard and I just can't take it in public for a long time. I have severe panic attacks and I'm working on therapy and getting better but I'm not there yet. I know I need to toughen up and get back to work I have kids to support. I've been told by family to get over it. And told to grow up panic attacks and depression and PTSD isn't real. They just don't know. I'm struggling so bad right now and desperately need baby formula for my baby son and diapers for both the baby and my toddler. My toddler has NO diapers as of now and my baby has ONE bottle worth of formula left. I've cried for the past hour because I hate myself because I haven't worked and now my sons have to suffer. I'm going to force myself back to work this Saturday. I have to do something now though to get the formula &amp; diapers. I called we have no diaper bank around here and the food bank doesn't have any formula that my son can eat nor diapers. All their diapers are usually gone instantly and they have no clue when they'll get more. I go to wic with my baby Friday so I just need to get him some to last til Friday afternoon. But I'm stuck on diapers and wipes..what can I do or where do I go from here? NO I AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING FREE OR ANY HAND OUTS..I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT WORKING AND THATS WHY I GOT HIRED BACK AND WILL BE BACK WORKING THIS SATURDAY.

She has never taken time for herself to truly be happy and experience life.  She uses “positive thoughts” to keep any of her problems hidden.

Instead of a home birth we ended up having an emergency C-section.  For a moment I thought I was going to lose my wife and child.  It was the most horrifying moment in both of our lives.

LongingWestward,"So I had PPD/PPA after my I had my son (almost 17 months) that ended up throwing me into a whole episode while I was alone on a business trip 2000 miles from home. My husband was working the whole time and I was trapped with my very very needy baby, under diagnosed PPD/PPA, and my MIL (who was supposed to be helping me) was basically MIA. I had been working with a therapist for like 2+ months and reached out to her as I was having some seriously crazy thoughts. I let her know it was an emergency and she said she would call me back within 30 minutes. I didn’t hear from her for two days. 

I was luckily able to talk to one of my BFFs (also a mom), who talked me through the worst of it, but that episode and the broken trust with my therapist meant that I shut down. I decided I would do it on my own, like every other effing hard thing in my life, and just push through. Here I am, almost 11 months later with.... a lot of issues. I’m realizing now that I never got through it. My husband and I had a come to Jesus fight (on our anniversary. Yay) where I asked him if he thought I had depression/PPD and he told me he was actually wondering if I’d developed bipolar disorder (sorry if that’s not the right term). My symptoms don’t fit bipolar, but I do have mood swings, as well as a host of other issues that read like lingering or unresolved PPD/PPA issues.

So the big problem now is that I’ve reached out to four different providers/practices: one isn’t accepting new patients and two don’t work with women past the one year mark. They keep trying to send me to generalized practices, one of which was the fourth one I contacted and they “don’t have anyone who works with perinatal issues”. 

Wtf. I just want to get fucking help. We spend all this time trying to destigmatize perinatal mood disorders and encourage women to get help and then when we do, we are let down and told “sorry, your disorder isn’t right for us”. 

I am literally in tears. I promised my husband that I would find someone this week and after getting turned away by four practitioners, I am feeling too drained and defeated to keep calling people. I’m a SAHM with very little support ATM and I’m at the point where I’m so tired and overwhelmed by the enormity of the issue that I just want to quit. Like “fine. Divorce me. Take the kid.

I am in therapy. But it just feels like I tell her the same thing over and over and making no progress. Like what’s the point of even talking to her? I never remember what I say to her, but I know it’s the same thing. 

My head hurts. My heart is broken. When I’m not flipping off my daughter when her back is turned, shes asking me why she can’t see her friends. Like I’m punishing her or something.

reeseaddict,"Hello! I am 4 weeks PP and I have generalized anxiety disorder and depression, and a history of PTSD. Currently I see a therapist and a psychiatrist and am on Effexor. I was on Effexor through my pregnancy and I do feel like it kept a lot of my APD symptom in check. I actually didn't know APD was a thing until I saw a post here.

TL; DR at end.

During my pregnancy I had a lot of struggles because my pregnancy was also high risk and my OB was awful. She would always be commenting about my baby's weight and it made me feel like I was doing everything wrong during my pregnancy. Thankfully she wasn't the person that delivered my LO, so at least that memory was okay.

I never felt bonded to my LO during my pregnancy but I let myself be okay with that because mostly I was just so focused on what I was eating since I had been warned about gestational diabetes and my LO's size. My anxiety was through the roof towards the end because of all of the things I felt like my partner and I had to get done before the baby was born. Getting the nursery ready, setting up all the furniture, cleaning the house, all of those were done with frantic energy and no sense of joy or excitement.

Now that I have my LO I feel upset that I didn't really experience any joy or excitement. I realize that I'm going through the same thing now. There are times when I am happy and I feel bonded to my LO but there are other times when I just shut down completely, I do it automatically, I guess as a way to protect myself from feeling anything too strongly.

I am struggling with breastfeeding too. I have low supply. My left nipple always seems to be sore. My LO used to have a good latch but seems to have regressed.

I know my therapist is going to tell me to stop breastfeeding but I am not ready to give up on it yet. I don't know if it is because it is the one thing about my plan for this baby that I can still have (baby was born in an unplanned c section after more than 24 hours of labor) or if I'm just being stubborn. I've started taking supplements to help increase my supply but who knows if they will work. I want to be able to move to pumping only if breastfeeding doesn't work out but my low supply worries me.

Mostly I just don't know where to go or what to do.  I really don't feel like upping my Effexor is the right thing to do but I also don't want to keep going like I am because while I can have a few good days in a row the depression and sadness is always hiding there, waiting to overwhelm me. I really can't even put a finger on what causes it or triggers it.

TL; DR: A kind of sadness rant about not knowing that APD was a thing. Sometimes I feel bonded to my LO, sometimes I feel just overwhelming sadness and depression so I shut down. I have a therapist, psychiatrist, and am already on Effexor because I my generalized anxiety disorder and depression, and history with PTSD. I really don't want to up my Effexor but I'm just not sure what to do. Also having issues with low supply and breastfeeding. I know my therapist will tell me to stop breastfeeding but I don't want to and I don't feel like that is going to help me. I really don't know what to do or how to figure out what triggers my sadness or depression.",Postpartum_Depression,Unsure what to do about depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/j6t5mi/unsure_what_to_do_about_depression/,1602110493.0,2020-10-07 15:41:33,1.5533376715384574e+19

NicotineSolitude,"21 years old with a 3 month old son and a history of severe depression.

Before I got pregnant it was finally getting better and I met my boyfriend. It wasn't perfect but I finally felt happy and thought I had someone who will love and accept me for who am.

Fast forward 2 years and we have a son. We didn't marry because neither of us believe we should force a marriage because of our son. If we wouldn't do it without him, then we wouldn't do it with him.

And guess what? That was a very smart decision on our part because... I can't stand him anymore.


I knew he wasn't all that mature and I didn't really blame him. We are young and inexperienced. But when we both agreed that we can't abort because of our moral codes, I at least expected that having a child would give him some wake up call. Make him more mature. Think about more than just his selfish needs and expectations.


3 months post partum, and I fucking resent him. When I gave birth, I did it ALL by myself for the first month. I didn't ask him to do anything because I didn't believe I should tell him to take care of his own child. I thought it would be common sense for him to step up and do it. I thought it would be common sense for him to realize I'm physically destroyed and need help.

Nope. Did it all by myself in silence while he continued his carefree teenage life like before. Playing games and messing around. I questioned how he isn't embarrassed to leave me to do everything on my own.
At one point I didn't have time for him because he left me on duty 24/7.

He had actual audacity to tell me he feels neglected. He asked for sex 2 weeks pp and was surprised to hear I can't and that I'm still bleeding. Like, what the fuck did he honestly think? That im made out of rubber and just stretch to pop the baby and then go back to normal immediately for round two?

Zero fucking knowledge or will to get informed.


A person would think, well maybe he just doesn't have experience with babies. Maybe he was scared. We are both equally experienced with children. We're not.

The only baby I ever held, interacted with or fed was exactly my son. Nobody asked me if I'm ready. Nobody asked me if I know what I need to do. Nobody explained shit to me. They gave me my son and I had to do it. I had to figure it out on my own. I had to figure him out on my own.

But somehow, my boyfriend deserved some kind of special treatment and ""time"". Fuck his time. I have no time because of his time.



When a whole month finally passed and I got tired of his shit, I told him my feelings. His response was ""well why didn't you ask?""


Ask? I didn't know that men can just enjoy life childfree until their wife specifically tells them to do something.


3 months have passed and he's finally taking care of our son. But honestly, it's too late.


When people say first impressions matter, they're correct. And the first impression was absolute garbage. It literally doesn't matter what he does now because any sympathy or love for him has evaporated from me. The saddest part about it is, he isn't even trying to make up for that month.

Now hes complaining how tired and exhausted he is. After feeding him 2/8 bottles in a day he just passes him onto me.

That's all he does. Diapers and bottles. He doesn't wash the bottles. He doesn't bathe him. He doesn't hold him. He doesn't entertain him. He doesn't do exercises with him. He doesn't know which medicine he takes or when. He doesn't bathe him. He doesn't know how to change his clothes. He doesn't iron his clothes. He didn't buy him a single damn thing. Not a single pack of formula we feed him. Not a single bottle.


I made him ""suffer"" the night duty because I want to sleep in peace. Ironically, my son sleeps through the entire night. So he isn't even under any duty until late morning.

He has no idea what I went though the first month.


But acts like he's rhe biggest victim and that we're somehow ""equal"".





I love our son. But I can't stand his father. He managed to ruin 2 years of my love for him in a single month. It's irreparable. I don't want any fucking therapy either. These are his true colours and fuck him for that.

I don't want to medicate myself because my boyfriend is a selfish dick. This isn't a me problem. It's not in my head. Anyone would feel fucking miserable even if they didn't have depression with a sack of shit like him.



At this point I'm keeping him around because I can at least finish a cup of coffee when I wake up. If I kick him out and dump I won't get the little bit of peace I have. So I decided to suck up his nonsense for the sake of my sanity.



Since we live with my parents, my mother has become a cherry on top. I appreciate them letting us stay under their roof without paying a single bill. However she's mentally tormenting me as well.

Whenever my son cries she just comes yelling at me in passive aggressive ton ""Your child is crying! Stop smoking and get your ass up!""


Yeah. It doesn't matter that i was with him since 1pm yesterday to 6am today. It doesn't matter that his father is right there next to him perfectly capable of feeding him himself.
I need go get up and drop my only coffee and free time to tend to him yet again. I'm a shitty mother for taking 2h break in 24h a day.


She also expects me to wash everyone's dishes. To clean the entire house and cook for all of us. She expects it every day. Just like she does without a baby.


""You're not a teenager anymore.""


I'm sorry what? So I should clean, cook, wash the dishes, iron clothes AND take care of the baby. All at the same time?



What in the goddamn fuck is left for everyone else to do then?



What is this misogynistic bullshit. What the fuck have I become?


A maid? A slave?


My father sometimes tells her to back off and leave me alone. He's the last person I expected to have any sympathy for me. Yet he of all people is that person.

Just fuck everyone.


I don't remember the last fucking time I showered or brushed my goddamn teeth. Or saw anyone other than my fucking boyfriend.


I'm STILL fucking bleeding. 3 months later. Something is wrong. But I just don't even give a fuck at this point. Bleeding to death is more preferable. And even if I gave any shit, I don't have time to shower, let alone for some doctors appointment. And if I do, I'd rather drown my misery in alcohol and cigarettes.

I drink every goddamn night and stay up until 4am. Because that is the only fucking time I can have for myself and my existence outside of being a mother. And then I get up at 11 and the cycle repeats itself.

And even that is fucking ruined right now from my boyfriend munching the fucking chips in another room so goddamn loud like he's fucking 5.



I feel so fucking horrible and done. If it weren't for my son and the smile he gives me in the morning, I'd just fucking end myself right now.

I was honest and straight forward with my doctors and nurses through the whole grieving process. But, honestly, I’m still grieving. Shortly after the funeral, lock down started so I spent the good majority of my pregnancy at home. I had a gestational diabetes scare and I was induced at 37 weeks because of gestational hypertension. After I was diagnosed with the hypertension, the doctors and nurses made a point to tell me every visit that it was okay if I began to feel symptoms of PPD after giving birth, especially with the death of my sister and the health crisis, they actually told me that it may intensify the symptoms. 

Fast forward three weeks to now. I am totally and absolutely in love with my daughter. It’s my husband and son that I’m struggling with. I’ve become combative with both of them to the point of yelling with my husband and crying fits with my three year old. I’m tired because I’m exclusively breastfeeding so no one can help with feedings. I think my husband has changed three diapers since our daughter came home so I’m doing all that. I still cook, clean, do the laundry and make sure the kids are bathed at the end of each night.

I am 4 months PP and I can't believe how slow time is going. I keep wanting to think it gets better but everyone keeps saying ""oh just wait till they start doing ____""... Great.

I didn't really have hobbies besides going out and now I'm always stuck at home. I'm not crafty or really active, I used to love swimming but I hate my body after my c section. I was starting to love myself after losing weight and feeling sexy before I got pregnant now I can't even look in the mirror. I hate my stretch marks that are over my old ones that were faded but they are all red again. My skin is flabby because I had a lot of fulid around the baby and my scar is the ugliest thing I've ever seen. My core feels non existent and I have a lot of pain in my back. 

I never wanted this baby even though I love her. I thought about an abortion but my man always said , ""I'll love you more after the baby is here"" , ""I'll be amazing when your pregnant."". None of that happened. He stopped having sex with me after my second trimester and I tried everything to fix it , he always told me it's him but I know it's because he wasn't attracted to my pregnant body anymore so I became a vessel for his baby rather then his fiance. He would rather watch porn while I'm frustrated. 

I also found out he was texting many other girls when I first got pregnant and for about 3 months out of our relationship. I am trying to be okay with it but who knows what else he hid. It's hard not to have resentment even if he's a good dad. I feel like he never looks at me like he used to.

I had a terrible pregnancy and was high risk, got a blood clot after and was in and out of the hospital for weeks and couldn't afford the needles I was suppose to keep taking so I always think that I still have clots. They are 20 a needle. 

I am sick of the diapers , bottles and crying when everyone I know is having a good time while I'm at home crying and staring at a wall. The rage I have is so out of hand sometimes too. I hate myself and I'm not a good mom.

Im just suffering in silence. I live with my family and they dont make it any better... My dad calls me pathetic when i cant calm my baby down at 2a and stupid and haa been ignoring me for a month. 

They dont help me get to work. Even though my name is also on the car I share with my mom she says for me to make my own way. I call an uber but she cant even be bothered to open the gate thru her phone. Thwn my dad goes on and on about how hes not doing shit for me blah blah.... Because of this i missed 3 days of work and theu say its still my fault.

cosmicxsunflower,"I thought things would be getting better by now, but at 6 months, my post partum depression is peaking. I am a single mom and I’m taking a very difficult class online that requires 30 hours of school work a week. The only break that I get is when my son is in daycare for two days a week because government assistance will cover the times when I’m doing schoolwork. It’s not a break though, because I have to cram my schoolwork in to those time frames. Even if I take a small break on those days, I am behind, and it’s not enough to be worth getting behind. 

None of my basic needs are being met and I am getting resentful. I moved back home from out of state since I couldn’t afford to raise a baby by myself. I don’t have any friends out here and I’m incredibly alone. Even if I did, I probably couldn’t see them anyway. My son is 20lbs already, and I am burning more calories throughout the day than I can make up for. He is going through a phase where he can’t handle me leaving the room for one second, and if he’s not entertained every waking moment, he screams. His cries cause a strong physical reaction for me, and it sends my body into a fight or flight response. I can’t relax, rarely have time to eat, and normal things that come with the territory of raising a child like being woken up before the sun comes up are upsetting me more than they should. My first thought in the morning is how I would love to have something to eat, and I hate that I have to feed him and change him first. I feel bad for having selfish thoughts all the time, because I know he needs me.

My friend came into town last week and I was really excited to see her, but he hated his new car seat and I had to pull over twice on the ride over there to cry and console him because he was screaming. I just wanted to do one thing for myself, and it seems like anything I want to do for me is more work than it’s worth. I wanted to catch up with my friend, but it’s really difficult to maintain a conversation when my attention is always divided. 

There is a virtual new mom support group through the hospital I delivered at, but of course, it is scheduled at the exact time that I have to be at an in person lab for my class.

My son won’t take a nap unless I set him down in his room with white noise and walk away. He screams for a few minutes when I walk out, which makes me feel guilty, but if I don’t do it that way, nothing works and he will be up and exhausted the entire day. That’s the only way they could get him to nap after trying everything at his daycare, too. I’m feeling guilty all the time because he’s getting needier as time goes on, and I often dedicate my entire day to pleasing and entertaining him, and it still isn’t enough. I also feel guilty because I get angry at the little things, and I’m always thinking about how I wish my life would be about me, just a little bit. It seems like it would be easier if I just gave up on wanting anything for myself because attempts to do something for me just end in frustration.

I need to know that it gets better. In the beginning I thought it would have improved a little bit by now. I am desperate. Anybody that would listen to me vent seems to be tired of it by now, so I’ve stopped reaching out because I don’t want to drain them.

UsuallyOk247,"Hi, I’m 29, my daughter will be 15 months in a couple weeks. I also have an almost 14 year old son from a previous relationship. (If you can even call it a relationship? We were children, anyways, I digress.) 
I got ppd pretty intense after I had my son, I was a very young teenager, his dad and I broke up very soon after he was born, and got A LOT of stretch marks during my pregnancy(like from stomach to calves), so as a very young vain teenager, it was a lot. I did not get any kind of medical treatment for the depression, my high school had a lot of support groups, so that is where I got my help. 

Now to the current. I’m a new stay at home mom, I quit my job (which I loved and worked very hard at) right before the pandemic. I was exclusively breastfeeding and cloth diapering my babe, so it just made sense. My husband started a new job with quite the raise, so all was good. 
Within a couple weeks of staying home, I started to feel like I was in a rut, had no motivation, and felt so irritable with my husband for no good reason. Then COVID happened, and he got laid off. His new job has a huge pay-cut while in training and he is also working from home. So we’re home together all the time. 
I don’t know if it’s postpartum depression , hormones still off from breastfeeding, being around my husband all day everyday, the craziness of the pandemic and everything else happening in our country, or a combination of it all, but I have become a huge bitch. I don’t feel like the same person. I am so irritated all the time, my husband is very helpful with our daughter, he’s amazing with my son, he helps around the house, really he’s the best, but I find myself annoyed at him all the time. Our sex life is technically good, but deep down it’s very hard for me to get going. My sex drive is nonexistent but I know I feel better during/after so I am a willing participant, but I have to fight through these very ugly feelings in order to enjoy myself. 
I don’t feel sad necessarily, and when I’ve gone to the doctors and taken those depression screenings, they never are concerned, but I feel like I’m becoming this irritable, ungrateful person and I really don’t like it. 
To add more complexity to the mix, we always talked about having one more child, and that time to start trying to conceive is getting closer and closer. I’m starting to get so nervous because I don’t want to be this miserable wife that loves her kids but is a bitch to her super sweet husband. 
I have another OB appointment where I will talk more openly about all of this, but it isn’t until the end of October. 
For the most part we do everything we’re supposed to. Yoga, run, we read self help books together every night, we drink a lot of water, eat home cooked meals 3x a day, all the good things. 
I don’t laugh with my husband as much, I find myself avoiding eye contact with him, I quickly become annoyed while cuddling or kissing.. it truly is breaking my heart.

Before I was pregnant and during my pregnancy my boys father was emotionally and mentally abuse but didn't physically hurt me. I stayed with him though when I shouldn't have. After I delivered my boys and got home things turned bad and he got extremely jealous of the boys getting my attention. And started pushing me, grabbing me, and them punching and slapping. Well today he was worse than ever and broke my wrist. I went to emergency room and got it x rayed and dry and cast put on. I called and had my friend pick me up and begged her to take me a few hours to my brother and sister in law s house. They told me to please come stay with them where I am safe until I could get on my feet.

Ella_surf,"I'm hoping this can help give hope to some of you. Obviously everyone's experience is different. 

TLDR: I'm practically weaned from my anti depressants and I feel pretty good. 

I had my first (and only) in Feb 2019. Around week 4, when we realized there was no end in sight of the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad nights, and that my husband was going back to work soon, I started getting really really anxious. My anxiety was all about sleep, baby was a terrible sleeper, and when she did I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking she would wake me up any minute. One evening when my husband started throwing up from a migraine when he got home from work I knew I needed to let him sleep (he'd been taking care of the baby most nights so I could rest between feedings) and I panicked. I called my mother for help crying and she spent a chunk of the night with the baby so we could both sleep a few hours. We put a plan in place where our friends and family coordinated and someone would come by everyday to let me have a break in the afternoons, and we spent most of our savings hiring a night nurse. 

But my issues weren't going away. I got a referral from my obgyn to a psychiatrist, I started seeing a psychologist every week and got put on antidepressants and Ativan for sleeping. Once we got the right dosage, the psychiatrist told me to see my GP a year later to wean off. Last month was a year later. I discussed the timing (hello pandemic) with my GP and she convinced me to try weaning anyways. As of now, I'm practically completely weaned off and I have seen no change in my feeling good since. Sleep is still difficult sometimes, but the gp have me some other meds that are more appropriate for sleep now that I've stopped breastfeeding. 

I was really scared to go on meds, but I'm so glad I did. I can barely remember the first few months of my maternity and I'm sad the depression took those away from me, but I am so thankful that I go to enjoy the rest of my baby's life. I remember clearly having a blast with my 6 month old and feeling so happy that the meds allowed me to enjoy that time. 

I was so so lucky to have the support system, finances, knowledge and medical access to get the help I needed. I am also so proud of myself that I asked for help, that I took the meds even though I was scared I'd be a slave to them for the rest of my life and that I've been making efforts to exercise more and have better sleep hygiene (that's still a work-in-progress).

nano_tech3,I've been dealing with PPD/PPA for almost 3 months now. Today was not a good day. My new born got his shots this morning and has been crying since due to the pain. Later in the afternoon I had to take my 5 year old to the dentist. It was a little rough since he didn't want to go so I had to bribe him with a happy meal. After his appt. I kept my promise and went to our nearest McDonald's and got him his meal. But then I noticed that they didn't give me his drink so I had to go back. For some reason this really upset him. We got home and he was just having the worst tantrum ever. He refused to eat and wanted to throw away his food I just bought. So I put it away and took him to our room so he can lay down and relax. This upset him even more and he said that I was going to go to jail and the cops were going to take me. So I said ok and walked out. He then locks our bedroom door so I went to open it because he can't unlock it himself and he's standing at the door with a box cutter. Luckily it's one that locks and he can't open. So once he sees me he tells me I need to die and leave. He's never acted like this. So I talk to him and he's more focused on the fact that I'm crying and asking why I'm said and I tell him because of what he said. I told him I was going to leave since that is what he wants. He runs to the door and locks it and tells me he's sorry but that it was my fault. I said I knew he was sorry and that it was ok but I still ended up leaving.

chubby_gengar,"Through a hookup from a friend I was able to secure a job until we move. It pays great and will allow me to save up for the move and will allow us to be paid up for a while. It’s a great job and I love it but it’s just not feasible for us to live where we are now- the price of living is way too high and it’s great pay but it’s not living great. Where we’re moving too my husband and I have been applying but it’s difficult if you don’t live in an area to apply for jobs because people often want physical interviews.

Husband has gotten many calls back and has a potential (great) job up there but if he isn’t able to there are tons of places that I’ve found that are hiring and have called me back as well. We also found a super amazing apartment that we’ll say without a job would be impossible to maintain but with either of us working we’d be fine. He’s now being so pessimistic and it’s so freaking frustrating because I feel like I’ve finally dragged myself out of this draining hole and things are looking up and he says things like “well we’ll see how it goes” and “hopefully she gives us our deposit back if we can’t find jobs” and I know they’re very reasonable fears but we were both so on board and I don’t know what happened- he’s also not the type to tell me until after the fact.

Arty-meows,"These fears started after i suffered through a panic attack that spanned about 24 hours after using goodys powder (a fast acting migraine powder) BEFORE i got pregnant. I felt like i was in hell. I suffered panic attack after panic attack and could barely function. I would get a panic attack after a temperature change, or miscounting money. I couldnt drive. I couldn't eat. I couldnt sleep. I was paranoid of dying 24/7. 

However i became pregnant shortly after and then it turned into fears of losing the baby, and then also dying. I spent most of my pregnancy paranoid about counting kicks, and pre ecclampsia and the like. Basically hypochondria. 

I spent all of my childs early months worrying non stop about losing her. It got to the point i actually couldn't be away from her, and she slept next to me in bed. I would wake up at every movement to check on her. I still do. My child is 1, and i see posts occasionally about someone losing their child out of random and it sends me into an intrusive thought hell. 

Obv i know therapy would be nice, but i need an in personality therapist and i get too comedic when I'm talking on video chat. I just want to enjoy being a parent. I hate seeing posts about people losing their children at 2 or 3 or 4 or something. My life would literally be ripped away from me and i would not be able to continue om without my baby.

Tziporah-296,"Nobody will read this. But I need to type this to make myself feel better.

I have not been one to admit that I have faults. I want to be perfect and try and act like my life is perfect, but that is never the case with anyone. Only God is perfect. 

For the past few years, I have struggled with sporadic anger and sadness. It comes and goes every few months, but I put it off as hormonal changes because my period was all wacky and I was trying to become pregnant and was pregnant. Once I had my baby 4 months ago, I was in total bliss. The nurses as my hospital warned me of postpartum depression, and they gave me all these resources to fall back on in case I thought i was suffering from it.

Then it happened.

My fiance and I will fight about the dumbest things, and usually we make up right away and move on. But two nights ago, I thought the cops could have been called. Read on my other two posts if you wish to know the details, I don't want to make myself more depressed trying to retype everything. I didn't harm myself or anyone, don't worry. I just made a lot of racket, stomping and screaming like a toddler over the dumbest argument ever. I cried and cried, screamed, kicked, stomped...I wanted to run away. I wanted to pretend I didn't exist. I wanted to wish I never met anyone or had a baby, or became a mother. 

How could I think such a thing...what kind of a mother am I?

I used to be so happy and bubbly...people used to tell me they always saw me smiling. My cheeks would often hurt from it. People told me I was kind, fun to be around, and an all around sweet person.

But now I feel like total shit. Every day Im sad and I just want to cry and sleep and not work...but worst of all...I feel angry and I don't know why. I decided to finally do something about it. I hate taking pills...I don't like being ""diagnosed"" with anything. I want to think Im perfect...but I'm not. So I set up an appointment with my doctor next week. Not gonna lie, Im a little nervous to go. I don't wanna take pills....but I might need it. Or yoga...or God...or meditation or aromatherapy...

To make myself feel better, Im going to spill out my feelings here. Im going to explain how much my baby means to me. Im probably gonna cry.

When she was born, I was washed over with extreme happiness...total bliss. I felt almost a godly love pouring out of me. Its hard to explain. I remember hearing her little cry...her warm and slippery skin...feeling her trembling body on my chest. Her little body was so warm and she whimpered so helplessly. I couldn't sleep...I kept checking to make sure she was breathing. I even pushed her little cart into the bathroom with me when I went to pee or take a bath because I didn't want to take my eye off of her. I was so in love....and still am. The first thing I noticed were her teeny fingernails. She has furry thighs which makes me laugh.

She is absolutely beautiful. Big blue eyes like the icy waters of Lake Michigan, smooth olive skin, and brown hair like sweet milk chocolate. Her toothless smile melts my heart...her dimple on her chin makes me think of her father. I love looking at her tiny little fingers. She loves to coo and crow at me when I breastfeed her. When we are together, I don't want to do anything, I don't want to be anyone. I don't want to think or do anything at all but hold her close and talk to her, hug her, and kiss her little face...and tell her all my deepest secrets. Her name is Lilly. And she is my daughter...and I love her very much.

I cant wait to watch her grow into a little young lady. Maybe when she is 24 like me, she will read back on this.

HoneyNutFruitLoop,I am 34 years old and I have five children. My youngest is a girl named Faith who just came home from the NICU Monday after 199 days. She was born at 26 week gestation. The social worker at the hospital where she was in the NICU set up a pediatrician appointment and a WIC appointment before we were discharged and the pediatrician appointment is Friday at 3:45pm and WIC is Monday at 11:30am. When we went home the nurse gave us a few samples or bottles or RTF of the formula that she eats. She has to have Elecare specialty formula because she has severe digestive issues and cannot tolerate dairy or certain amino acids. We just ran out completely of the formula that they sent home with and due to my job firing me the day I went into labor prematurely because I had to leave work to rush to hospital. I have Zero money to be able to buy a can because going back and forth to the NICU for 199 days and taking care and supporting my other children wiped me out. I didn't save any money to buy any because the nurse said she thought she sent enough until WIC but NO it wasn't. I had never priced the Elecare formula until today and it is $42.44 PER CAN and I mean just ONE can.  I need to get a can as soon as possible because she has to eat every three hours and I have 41 minutes til it's time. you guys I have asked ally friends and family for help and no one can help. I went to my local social services and talked to a worker about help and she called food banks and things for charity and NO ONE has the Elecare formula. Local churches turned us down and said they had no funds and couldn't help. I have cried all afternoon and night and begged God to send help and idk I am losing hope. I feel like such a useless mother that has failed her daughter. She has to eat and it's very important for her because her being a preemie and still tiny she has to grow. So I'm asking for help! Yes I said it..I know I will get bashed and talked shit to but everyone told me that I should never be afraid to ask for help for my children and etc. Well here I am and hope and pray that someone will help my girl out so I can rest easy. I'm just tore up inside not knowing what to do. If any one could help us to get the Elecare for my daughter to be able to eat o will be so grateful and couldn't thank you enough.

It’s been night and day as far as my emotions go having someone else beside me to help. I’ve felt like I can function more. Last week, I hit a dark place and was so angry with my baby that I wanted to just throw him. I didn’t, but when that thought crossed me mind, it broke me. I sobbed and felt like that was the final straw for me. I realized then that I can’t keep living this far away from my family in the mental state I’m in, so we’re moving back home. My husband saw how much I needed help and knew this would be best for our family, so he resigned and is going to be staying home with the baby while I continue to work remotely.

But now we’re moving 300 miles away from family and he’s getting a job so now he’s saying that he’s not going to be helping with the night shift.

A little preface. I was alone for a little under 3 weeks because he was looking for a job in a different state and was staying with family. And all that time, more or less, I did nights and days and all he said was I’m sorry I’m not there. Since he got back he’s been phenomenal and has really helped when he senses I might need a little break. But his job would require him to work afternoons and evenings but probably nothing past 8 or 9.

layrenee92,"Hi ladies,

I’m glad I found this sub because I feel a bit alone. I had my baby boy in March right when covid really hit so it’s been a bumpy ride. I was on Elavil 50 mg throughout my entire pregnancy and three weeks ago I quit.  It was great for depression, but the years I took it, I had severe stomach issues so I finally gave it a stop. The stomach issues seem to have subsided and my withdrawal symptoms lasted about two weeks. Now, the depression is back, I’m nauseous 24/7, I can’t sleep ( which is expected with a baby) and I have panic attacks all day. My doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine for sleep (but it only worked a day) and she prescribed lexapro. I took it for two days and was constantly puking so I just quit. I feel so hopeless and like such a terrible mom. I should be taking him for strolls or just going by the swing and I feel too depressed to even get up. I just don’t have it in me. I look at his smile, I start crying and apologizing for not being the mom he deserves. All I keep thinking is how I’m failing my son and I hate that. I’m scared of being on any type of benzodiazepines because my mom was an addict growing up and I fear I’ll do that to my son.

I’ve started therapy. I’m also 14 weeks pregnant. Unplanned. I’m terrified. I’m terrified of the impending deadline until this baby is born. This deadline to get my shit together. I want to be better. I will drown if I’m not. I won’t be able to do this with a newborn. My family live in a different state and due to Covid we have been in lockdown, which is definitely contributing to my struggle. 

I’m trying to be positive and focus on recovery but the pressure of needing to be ‘better’ by March is so overwhelming and stressful. I am hesitant to start medication, mainly because I’m scared I won’t ever be able to stop taking it like my mother. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? For some reason medication just scares the shit out of me even though I’ve been assured it’s safe for pregnancy. I am scared I am damaging my relationship with my son and am risking damaging the relationship with my son-to-be so am determined to improve, I guess I’m just really lacking in confidence.

esmereldaskysurfer,"PPD is always talked about, the OB screens for it after the birth, the baby's pediatrician screens for it after the birth, women are encouraged to look for signs and see a doctor if they think they might have it.

But there's one they *dont* talk about: Antepartum depression.

I found out this is a thing today, after experiencing months of dark, disturbing thoughts about my pregnancy. Not feeling connected to my baby AT ALL, sometimes not even remembering im pregnant, sometimes i would be like ""i feel like utter shit and i dont know why"" then a few minutes later would remember, oh yeah, im pregnant. Im 18 weeks and feeling the baby move, seeing them move around on the ultrasound and i feel NOTHING. Just sadness, and anger, and resentment and regret.

This wasnt a planned pregnancy, which i think is one of the reasons why i became so depressed (that and i have type 1 Bipolar, so im in a high-risk category for developing it). I feel like getting pregnant ruined my life, and have resented the fuck out of this life that has survived so many battles just to get here (i have fertility issues, so technically *cant* get pregnant without help, yet somehow did, then they didnt expect the pregnancy to survive past the 1st trimester). Yet i cant be happy. 

It didnt feel like a typical Bipolar depression, so i concluded that i must just be a shitty person who hates her baby, and even started thinking about adoption. I mentioned this to a friend who works in Mental Health, who said there were red flags all over the place in what i said, and told me to read up on Antepartum Depression. When i did, i was like ""oh but that's exactly how i feel..."". It feels, for me, a lot like PPD did when i had my first. Lots of dark thoughts about getting rid of the baby somehow (with my first i used to sit crying, thinking about taking him to a fire station and leaving him there), thinking about self harming in some way, not feeling bonded, etc.

Im going to call my psychiatrist on Monday, to talk about adjusting my meds to combat this. But even just knowing, this is a real thing and is not just me being a shitty person, helps a lot. He doesnt have an out of hours line, or i'd call that, and the local mental health support center is fucking useless because they cannot prescribe anything, so it's great if you want to sit in a room with a counselor for an hour and talk about it, but that's all they can do. My other options are the ER (no thanks, dont want Covid) or the local psych hospital where as soon as i started talking about wanting to self harm, would 5150 me for 72 hours and i dont think i need that.",Postpartum_Depression,The one they still dont talk about: Antepartum depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/ij50ti/the_one_they_still_dont_talk_about_antepartum/,1598779165.0,2020-08-30 02:19:25,1.7875068844342382e+18

Sea-Lawfulness87,"I need to let this out. I love my boyfriend with all my heart. So much that it hurts.

A little backstory: when I first found out I was pregnant I was 4weeks along. I was scared that he didn't love me and that if I told him about the baby that he'd stay just for that. I was going to write a note saying that I couldn't handle a relationship anymore, wasn't going to tell him about the pregnancy and just terminate it. But he found out about the baby before I could. I also want to say that I was told at a very young age there was about a 2% chance of me getting pregnant, let alone going to term and baby being viable. I was about 6/7 months pregnant in October and we got into a stupid argument that got a little heated. I asked why he was with me if I made him that sad and he pointed at my belly. A few hours later he came back and said the only reason he said that was because he was mad...I believed him. 

Now:  I'm 7 months postpartum. Two days after taking baby home we argued, he told me he knew from a month into us that we wouldn't last. Took it back and said he was mad..I believed him.  Around the 1 month mark we got into another little argument while putting the crib together, we were using the basinet but baby got too big. It was a stupid argument about where to put the crib. It got heated and he admited to me that the only reason he talked me out of abortion was because he felt bad for me. That he didn't want a baby but it could be my only chance at being a mom. 
It took me a while but I realize that he did mean what he said. That I ruined his life. I hate myself for that every single day. 

I've kept all of that to myself. For nearly a year. I can't tell anyone because I'd get a big fat ""you were stupid"" thrown at me. He's the only guy I've ever been with. We were barely together a month before getting pregnant. I'm so broken and alone. I needed to get that off my chest rather someone sees this or not.

thearablife,"I just want to write it down to maybe get through one day without resenting my baby. I’m 2 weeks postpartum and I just want these feelings to go already. I’ve had them all my pregnancy and now it’s like they’re bubbling up and bursting out at the slightest trigger. My husband is overseas and there is a language barrier between us that sometimes doesn’t let me communicate what I want him to understand. 

To my husband: 

I told you when we got married that we should wait to have kids. You said you wanted to start now so we can enjoy our lives later. 

I love our son and wanted him to be enough for you for a little while but you insisted on a second baby when he didn’t even reach the 2 year mark. I told you we don’t know what will happen with the immigration. You told me you have it covered and I’ll probably deliver with you by my side. You gave me false hope. No one could’ve predicted COVID, but I told you something might happen and you only thought about yourself. 

I told you to choose between a baby or having me and our son come for another visit later in the year. You chose a baby. It broke me that you chose having a child over me which forced me to go through another pregnancy and labor delivery alone again. One week postpartum and you’re already telling me to come back to your country and travel alone with a newborn and toddler during a fucking pandemic. Are you insane? 

I had to go through postpartum pain alone again. I have to breastfeed at night and all day on demand alone again. I went through unimaginable and constant pain. I have to juggle a newborn and a jealous toddler. I’m alone and there’s nothing worse than feeling like a single mother while married. 

I’m angry that I finally have the girl I always dreamed of and I can’t even love her properly. I’m terrified of leaving her alone for one second that her justifiably jealous brother might harm her. Im scared that a kiss or hug will trigger him or further his jealousy. I’m living in a constant state of nerves and fear and anger. 

Can you stop saying “I know” or “I feel you” or “I understand” when I bring up the pain or the fears? You don’t know. You don’t feel me. You don’t understand. Trying to minimise how I feel or telling me “everything will be okay don’t worry” doesn’t make me feel better. I’ve told you this. I want solutions. I want HELP. 

You promised me a lot of things when I came back to the States. You didn’t deliver on any of them. My resentment grew from that day forth. And I wish to God I can get rid of these feelings for you so that I can finally connect to my little girl. You don’t know how these feelings for you have affected my connection to her. She was supposed to be my every dream and hope come true. Instead, I can’t find it in me to love her. 

It doesn’t help that I miss my little boy. I miss our alone time together. I miss sleeping next to him. I miss the way we were together. I hate how I can’t be with him like I used to. How the simple act of lifting him is painful for me right now. He knows. He comes to forcibly take snuggles and kisses when it used to be me offering them and that hurts me. It hurts me so much that he feels he has to do that. 

I’ve been distant with you for months but you’re so damn thick and self-absorbed that you haven’t caught on or even asked why. I’m at a breaking point and no one even noticed not even you. Im going to have a good long cry in the shower today if I can manage to grab one to help release some of this and hopefully it helps.

victoria-lisbeth,"I'm not always sad or anxious. Sometimes I get angry. Sometimes none of that is even about the baby, or me.

Sometimes I just get so angry at my husband I want to put his head into the wall. It was his turn to feed the baby, the baby was making his I'm hungry sounds. Baby quieted down so husband decides to wait until he's more awake. Well baby began to make more noise and get more agitated so I got up. Husband got offended, saying he was going to feed him. 

I snapped at him. I told him that if thats what he's going to do then do it now because the baby was about to cry and I didn't want to hear any kind of irritation or anything toward him if that happened. That if he couldn't handle getting his ass out of bed to tend to our child when he needs it right then, then to let me know and I'll handle it like I have been for the last month and a half. 

I'm still mad. Partly because he would just leave our child whimpering in his crib and partly because I've been the one to stay awake all night with the baby when needed, the one who would get up at all hours and only be able to doze at night, just to take care of him in the day while husband works from home. I've reached exhaustion and driven right by it to the land beyond.

But he doesn't want to get out of bed for one feeding? 

Now I'm spiraling between anger and depression and anxiety because of what he did and I hate it. Today was an OK day. I was managing to be pretty even. Now I'm all thrown off and its 3 in the morning.

What really worries me is that it’s affecting my job. I’ve made some mistakes because I’m losing my focus and getting overwhelmed. I’m working from home since the pandemic hit. I have struggled to handle distance learning for my oldest, working full time, and taking care of my son during times when daycare was not available.

At this point, I’ve been written up for a couple of stupid mistakes at work. My boss says I’m on thin ice until I show I can be consistent. And yes, my boss knows about my ppd, and has some sympathy, but also high expectations.

I don’t know what to do to get better. I’m sure if I had less on my plate and could find time to exercise and get healthier, I could get over this postpartum hormonal imbalance. I used to be so productive. Now I can barely do anything well. I’ve overloaded.

I’ve been talking Zoloft for a few months now, and it is helpful. I’m not crying all day anymore, and am able to handle more things. I‘ve had some good therapy sessions, as well. But - I’m still struggling to take care of my family and keep my job.

I keep thinking maybe I should quit my job and stay home with the kids for a couple of years. Financially, it would be rough, but maybe possible. I could rest, make sure my kids are doing well, support my husband as he grows his career, and have time to get healthy again. I could get a certification, maybe volunteer in a professional organization to keep my resume current, and go back into the workforce when my son enters pre K. 

 I’m not sure, though, because before all this I loved my job. It is a great opportunity. And I’m afraid of leaving us with one income.

0yuria0,"Hi everyone. I am 3 months postpartum and have ppd and ppa. I've struggled with both in the past and they got really bad since having my son. I've been lucky to have my husband home but he is returning to work next week and I am terrified. 

I was making progress but the last week has been very bad. I'm waking up with crippling anxiety attacks and can barely get out of bed. All I want to do is sleep so I dont have to feel this way. 

I feel like I can't do this with him back at work. I'm barely managing even with him being home. I feel totally hopeless and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I can't go on like this. 

I am on medication and am in a perinatal mood disorder program where I meet with a specialized nurse weekly via zoom so I am getting help but I seem to be getting worse again.

katiebugz1994,"Some days I’m ok but it’s still always there. Some days I can fool myself that I feel closer to normal.. and some days I can barely make it through. 
 I had my second c section on February 27th at 9:27 PM.. I was in labor for 36 hours and the last 15 minutes of my labor I got an epidural, then my daughter couldn’t handle the pitocin from the induction anymore and my epidural turned into a spinal and I was wheeled into the operating room.. so high I couldn’t feel how terrified I was, I could hardly keep my eyes open. 
Hearing the doctors count out the tools they are going to use.. and then the anesthesiologists behind me let me know it was beginning.. I was being cut open again. It felt like forever feeling my body being tugged around but not feeling anything at the same time.. hearing the doctor say she’s a big baby and hardly being able to focus on her above the curtain. Wanting to cry but feeling nothing at the same time, fighting to keep my eyes open to see her on the table while they cleaned her. Fighting with every fiber of my body to remember the moment my daughter was born earthside.. they wheeled me into the recovery room and my husband who never left my side watched as I was shaking trying to hold my newborn. I could see the love for her and the fear for me in his eyes.. 
the next 3 months were terrible. Panic attacks 3 or more times a day, worrying if today was going to be the day I died, not being able to go to sleep from all the adrenaline my  body was still producing. People and life not feeling or looking real.. wondering if I’m real, if I’m here or did I really die on the table. 
6 months down and I’ve improved somewhat, I no longer get panic attacks because I’ve learned to control them.. still feeling empty on the inside and at times When I’m really still I can’t feel my arms or legs and I worry that I’ve finally lost control of my body..

throwaway77442424,"Not even sure where to start...
 My wife is just over 3 months postpartum with our twins. These are our first. 

The first few weeks were normal rough. Sleeping was an issue. Breastfeeding difficulties. My mother in law basically moved in to help out full time which has been great allowing my wife or myself good chunks of time to catch up on sleep when needed. 

We stopped breastfeeding because it became too much after about 6 weeks. So when we switched to formula we changed the feeding schedule. And a week later we changed it again. A few day’s later changed it again, and again and again.  I really don’t even remember why we made the changes but basically it was going back and forth between 3 and 4 hour schedules to try and fit within our twins wake and sleep windows and for a few other legitimate reasons (reflux issues, work schedules, etc.)

Long story short for the past 6-8 weeks now my wife has had this narrative that all our changes in the schedule early on have negatively effected the babies. She feels that by making so many changes we’ve altered their brains causing some sort of neurological deficiencies. She’s afraid that we’ve somehow managed to damage their development along the way. 

We see our pediatrician regularly and even see another Pediatric doctor on occasion because the twins came early and spent time in the NICU. Both doctors have seen nothing but great things with the twins. Their weight gain is on track and getting better each visit. They are hitting all developmental milestones. They are showing all positive signs (smiling, laughing, grabbing, etc). The only real struggle I see is consistency with their sleep but we’ve settled on a routine in the last month and it seems to be working. Work in progress but working. 

Sorry lot of information here but I really don’t know how else to explain it. 

So my wife keeps saying these things about how we “altered” them. We messed them up with the schedule changes, unintentionally but they are messed up etc. 

I know what she see’s is flawed. The doctors know what she’s seeing is not really there. 

Basically she’s going through this postpartum depression/anxiety/psychosis and there doesn’t seem to be anything to change her mind or show her anything different then the negative lense she’s looking through. 

She’s been talking with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now ever since her feelings started and has been taking a few different medications in trying to calm her nerves and clear her views. 

She doesn’t feel that there is anything “wrong” with her. She doesn’t believe she is postpartum even though the doctor has diagnosed her as such. 

Basically I’m just asking, is there anything more i can do besides having her continue to talk with doctors, take medicine and hopefully one day soon see how wonderful our twins are? Most days it’s like 1 step forward 3 steps back. 
Each day all she can see are these “negative” issues with the twins and no positives. No one else involved see’s anything negative and her only justification is “mothers instinct”

Sorry for rambling and hopefully you can understand my questions/thoughts. I’m just confused and looking for something to help me continue in a better direction.

I'm very new to this, but I would be so grateful for some advice. I recently moved countries, and my best friend back home just had a baby 6 weeks ago. Because of covid19 I haven't been able to visit.
Since giving birth she's been miserable, sad, hopeless, scared. Feels no connection with the baby, feeling suicidal. All the classical symptoms.
Her partner unfortunately isn't very understanding.
I've been trying as hard as I can remotely. Gotten her in touch with a therapist and she's on some meds now to help her sleep etc. I've been reading all your messages on this forum to try and find ways to help. But she is struggling and I feel powerless. Noone in her friend/family group has any experience with postpartum depression so she feels guilty, lonely, and is losing hope. 
I call her every day but it's so hard to not be able to help more.
Could anyone advice a good book/community/forum?
She's not on Reddit, and she lives in Belgium, if that helps...

Awkward_Ship4354,"So I had my baby 4 months ago and he is fantastic. Really great baby, couldn’t have gotten luckier. I for whatever reason am having a very hard time focusing on the present, and being grateful for what I have. Instead I feel guilty and stressed out. 

My husband and me had him when we were 31/39. I realized after having him that we didn’t think about the long-term we just thought about when the time was right. Now I feel like we should have had him earlier and waiting was a disservice to him. 

I’m constantly worried about dying and not being around to take care of our baby. I started worrying about how I don’t have to worry about my parents getting old and dying until I’m in my 50s but our baby may have to worry about that in his 30s. I keep reading stuff about how kids hated having older parents and they ended up as caretakers at a younger age. Again, I didn’t think of ANY of this before now... 

I know I want another one too but I worry about having another one because my husband will be in his 60s when they graduate high school. I know that seems so old to a teenager... Again, didn’t think of any of this UNTIL AFTER HE WAS BORN. 

Then I read all this stuff about how parents don’t have the energy to parent in their 40s/50s, I find out that risks increase for men after 40, and the best part of having an older parent is financial stability which we DID have but we both lost our jobs, had to sell our house, and move in with my parents because of freaking covid.

Now I feel like we just selfishly waited until we were ready and we created a mountain of problems for my little guy. Every time I see him I just think about how I’m going to die and leave him all alone. I want to throw up.

The worst part of all of this is EVERYONE told me to have kids right after we got married at 24/32 and I didn’t listen. I was too scared and I wasn’t ready and now I feel like I totally messed up my kids life before it even gets started.

alex_zelda,"I'm (23F) in a rut where I both feel guilty and rage towards my husband (24M) at all times.  I feel guilty because a lot of the time, I shut down and walk away because I'm depressed, leaving him to parent our (6Month M) baby alone in that moment.  I feel rage because the reason I'm so tired is because my husband snores very, VERY loudly in bed at night, leaving me up for 1-2 hours after we turn in, and doesn't want to get help to see why he's snoring so loudly.  I feel guilty because I yell sometimes.  I was raised in an abusive household, and my husband is such a gentle soul.  He never yells at me.  Occasionally I yell at him about the stupidest things.  Sometimes he will come home from work and I'll immediately (without saying hello) ask him why he didn't put his dishes in the sink or something stupid.  These are all new problems since we had the baby.  I was incredibly depressed until I stopped breastfeeding, and now I am just reeling from how different my life is.

I used to travel around town and see a different set of faces every day for work.  Then I got furloughed.  So now I'm a stay at home mom.  I used to think that I wanted to be a stay at home mom, but not anymore.  It's so stressful.  It's like the baby knows when I'm about to eat or relax and he starts fussing for my undivided attention.  Hormones are still making me feel sick all the time.  I'm exhausted.  I can't sleep but I want to sleep.  My anxiety was OFF THE WALLS when I was pregnant, I was constantly worried about my baby because of DFM, and now I'm like ""it'll be okay"" about everything.  Paci falls on the floor?  Wipe it on my shirt, it'll be okay.  Small stuff like that.  Yet I still can't let him cry for more than five seconds before rushing to him because my mama heart can't stand to hear him cry.   My husband keeps me awake with his snoring, so in the morning (hubby works evenings for context) I tell him to take the baby out to the living room so I can sleep longer.  Only to wake 30 minutes later to the baby crying because my husband can sleep through anything and has fallen asleep on the couch.  I had a 4-day induction at the hospital in which my husband slept MUCH of the time, long, 8-hour stretches and would wake up looking lethargic.  Then in postpartum, he was asleep when the baby started crying in his bassinet.  He was screaming bloody murder and my husband was RIGHT NEXT TO HIM and slept through the entire thing.  Then when I woke him (FINALLY) He had the nerve to tell me that he was suffering from ""sleep deprivation"" (by this time we had been there 5 days and I had slept maybe six hours cummulatively).  I called my nurse to come wheel me through the postpartum ward and sobbed to her about how unfair it was that he said he was 'sleep deprived.'

The extent to which I do lash out at my husband doesn't even scratch the surface compared to the amount that I internalize.  Of all the times I feel a fire of anger go through me about some pet peeve or problem I have with him, I might mention it maybe 5 percent of the time.  Which is still too often.  I know my husband has things that bother him about me too but when I open the table to discuss our issues he just says ""It's okay hon, I know you're tired and the baby is hard to take care of on your own"" so instead of being an ass and talking about the things that are bothering me about him, I internalize them.  How could you say something negative about someone to their face right after they said that?

So yeah, I guess postpartum rage, maybe, at my husband?  But he has such a gentle way and he doesn't deserve all the rage I'm internalizing.  I keep a lot of it in because I don't want him to know.  I don't want to break him.  I know I make it sound like I am mean to him a lot but I try so hard to take the time to let him know how much I appreciate and love him.  He has been amazing through all this and has never asked me to wake up and hold the baby because he was tired.  He just also pisses me off sometimes.  And I know I'm not perfect.  He has a much gentler way of pointing out the things that I do wrong.  I'm talking to a therapist once a month which is really helping.  I love my husband and I don't want to feel this rage towards him.  It's not fair to him.  He works so so hard for our family.

I feel like I am turning into my dad and I'm scared.  He was an extremely angry man, extremely abusive with his words.  None of us kids will talk to him anymore.  He is alone and living in the bed he made.  I don't want that for myself.

fsppd,"hello,

its been an year now since i delivered but the mood swings and state of depression seems to intensify every month.

i am a 28 yr old mother with my first child born last yr, the phase i never wanted to go through for like next 3-4 yrs till i was settled in my life career wise and financially.

being a workaholic person, i wanted to study and build a career in a new country that me and my husband planned to immigrate to. but i had a unplanned pregnancy before moving to the new place and my husband really wanted me to have the baby because for him, having atleast one baby was important before it got ""too late"" to conceive. hence i had a sad sort of pregnancy because i was at home most of the time, which i never wanted to, making me more and more frustrated.

the hormonal changes made it impossible for me to study and prepare for the licence exams in the new place hence i decided i will postpone tit till the next yr. soon after delivery, i opted for a job which was some what related to my filed, so that i could go out the home and meet other people. 

i feel i have an additional burden now to look after and manage my schedule according to others now. i lack time for myself and miss going out for trips without carrying tons of baby luggage in the car. i do have parents to look after the kid but still i have to find time to spend with him along with other house hold work. i miss my old care free days where i only thought about my work and home. 

my husband has been supportive and motivates me to start studying again but i am not able to concentrate at all. the scenario was totally different 2 years back, when i had confidence and motivation and could study peacefully. 

when i see my other married friends enjoying their independent lives to the fullest, achieving things which i have missed make me feel jealous. i have cut down my phone communication to everyone because i feel i have nothing to talk about except the baby and maybe because i do not want to know how much my friends are enjoying.

i do not think i was ans still an ready for the baby and accuse my husband for making me having one so soon. PS. i had a case of uterine fibrosis and some doctors thought we should plan early. i believe i would have conceived later too and there was no need to rush.

mu husband is asking me to seek professional help but i dont want to take medicines as i feel it will make me dependent on the pills.

kaywi123,"I'm a stay at home mom with my 8mo baby. Since birth he's just been a difficult baby, as in barely sleep at night baby, can never take a full 2-hour nap baby, always crying, always need attention, always want to be held. We tried everything to improve his sleeping (see doctors, sleep training, eat full before going to sleep,...) He wakes up on average about 10 times per night, the only way he'll go back to sleep is I nurse him to sleep. I tried to let other people put him down but he.can.not.be.put.down by anyone else but me.

I'm just always tired, stressed cause I don't get enough sleep at night or during the day. My husband works most of the time, even when he's home he can't hold the baby for too long cause he has back injury.

I don't want to sound ungrateful but sometimes I just wish I don't have a child, I miss when the house is quiet and not filled with crying and screaming, I miss an 8-hour night sleep. I'm always crying and depressed, where I live therapists aren't a thing and it's hard to get help.

questions412,"I (24f) don’t wanna sound ungrateful because I am extremely thankful for my family I have created with my husband (27M). We have two girls (2f) and (1f) and most days I’m feeling so nostalgic about my past life. Before I met my husband I was a traveling escort, sugar baby and whatever else category you’d wanna put me in. I was used to making fast money, took extreme pride in my physical appearance, always looked sexy and could just get up and go at the drop of a dime to a new city. 

Being a mom sucks in my opinion. My husband is very helpful in all aspects but I still dislike having kids. My youngest is super clingy and cries for everything and especially when you try taking stuff out of her hands and mouth to keep her from hurting herself. My oldest is a bit more easier to deal with but is going thru a “terrible twos” faze and sometimes doesn’t like to listen or is sneakier than ever. I hate having to wait until the kids are tired to sleep. I hate having to be woken up to the sound of crying. I hate having to change someone else’s messy diapers, it makes me sick to my gut. 

I hate having to always share my meals even when the kids are being fed the same exact thing. I see everyone else who is childless that I know traveling left and right and it sends me into depression because that used to be me. Most days I haven’t any enough energy to even shower. I tried buying nail supplies and makeup from amazon to give myself a hobby but I can never get into it because someone is always needing attention. I honestly hate it here and sometimes wish my husband and I would split so I wouldn’t feel guilty about not keeping the kids, I kind of would want to get rid of them. Either by him taking them or maybe calling CYF and letting them deal with it. 
 
I love my kids but I didn’t get to experience enough of my youth before I had them and they drain me to the point where all I do is plot on how to get away from my family. That’s not healthy and I’m not happy. Advice please

shortyr87,"I may not have ppd but I have been feeling so sad over the past few weeks. My first daughter is 10 weeks and I feel like she will grow up without any grandparents. To give some background, my husbands parents disowned him a week after she was born because we chose a Hindu name instead of a Bengali name for her. His dad emailed us a week after she was born with some harsh words, but basically saying I am an evil Muslim and not welcome in a Hindu family. We are both not affiliated with any religion and have never said we will be raising her as either Hindu or muslim. We have been together for 5 years and married for one year and they never once said they were not accepting of the fact i was born muslim. We have not told anyone but everyday I am sad for my husband. It was his birthday on aug 4 and my husband called them to make amends and they never bothered to call back. 

On my side my mom passed away 6 years ago and my dad remarried 2 years ago. They have seen my daughter twice. I asked my dad if he can look after her for 30 min on Monday so we can renew our mortgage and he said no they are not comfortable watching her. I then told him he is the only grandparent she has and he said he’ll try and convince my stepmom. They have not called to say we can bring her over and our conversation was 2 days ago. I don’t want to force him if he has no interest and I feel he has remarried and I am left over trash from his previous marriage of 34 years. My dad has family get togethers with his new wife and we are not invited. 

I feel like we have random friends who treat my daughter better than her own grandparents and it’s so hard to miss my own mom everyday and today I cried just holding my daughter when putting her to bed. Two sets of alive parents want nothing to do with her. It’s different if they were dead, but to be alive and doing this by choice. 

To top it off I have been so stressed breastfeeding and she is gaining weight slowly. I had a tough pregnancy and a tough delivery which ended up in an emergency c section. She had tongue tie which was only diagnosed at 6 weeks and she is still not gaining weight. My husband is great but it’s so hard when we need parents to help us too. We have done everything by ourselves and will continue to do so, but it is such a sad situation. Everyone has at least one parent to help. Or the parents are out of the city. My parents are in the city but my in laws are 3 hours away. Sometimes it would be nice just to talk to my mother in law and get her guidance. It is unfortunate they are missing so much of our daughters life. 

I feel so helpless and sad most of the time unless I am with my daughter. I just wish more than anything my mom was here because I know I would be able to ask her for anything.

aleague2017,"So last Sunday (July 26th) I gave birth to my daughter. (She’s the first child I’ve given birth to, I had a miscarriage previously and have a 12 year old step son) She came after 8hours of labor and under 30minutes or pushing. Completely unmedicated birth. (Not my plan, but that’s how it ended up going.) I was diagnosed with postpartum panic disorder the day after I was discharged from the hospital. 

I don’t think it sunk in that I was pregnant my entire pregnancy. It just never felt real. I went to my appointments and took care of myself but it never really felt real. I didn’t ever feel connected to her before she was born. I sung to her once because I felt like I should, but it felt really weird so I never did again. The first two days after she was born, my brain didn’t register that she was born. I took care of her but I didn’t register she was mine? It more felt like, “This is a newborn and newborns need taken care of so I will do that.” rather than acknowledging that she’s my newborn?? But then suddenly I went completely 180 and now at 6 days postpartum she’s the ONLY person I feel connected to. I don’t feel connected to my mom. I don’t feel connected to my step son. I look at my fiancé and I know logically I love them but I don’t really feel it anymore. They’re an amazing parent and have been doing so much for our daughter and I and I’m really glad we have them in our lives, but honestly they feel more like a really good friend than my fiancé. I don’t know what to do about it.

BeautifulVictory22,"Hi new on here.... About to get completely real with you guys because I am absolutely tired of burdening my family. 
I have suffered with depression for quite a while and before I got pregnant things were looking up and I was doing really good. Then I got pregnant. 
Quick background: I am 24 currently and the Father of my son has been and on and off again relationship for about 10 years. I broke it off about 90% of the time. I think he did like 1 or 2 times. Don't know why I can't commit. And to be quite Frank never wanted to commit to anyone or anything. I do know I love him and he loves me but I feel my connection with anything is very fleeting

Back to story: 
We were not together when I got pregnant and he was actually planning on moving a couple hours away to finally cut completely ties with our relationship because it has been so toxic. Almost didn't tell him because I knew that's what he needed was to move and if I told him I was pregnant he would stay. But I ended up telling him and we tried to work it out romantically but didn't seem to work. Anyways, throughout the pregnancy I kept having thoughts of abortion or just killing myself. Normally it was abortion so that I felt better about killing myself. 
My son is born and he is full of so much love and purity that it completely overwhelms me. I try so hard to connect with this child of mine but just like my relationship with his father and everyone else in my life it is fleeting... 
His father started noticing me changing as he got to be about 1 years old and started needing me less, which when people don't ""need"" me that's when I start to slip further, so he started mentioning it to me and I honestly have completed numbed myself to feeling things or acknowledging my thoughts by being on social media or just watching comedic series on Netflix. One day after yet another conversation with someone where I felt like I failed, I had overwhelming thoughts of ending my life. Mind you the conversation was about me not letting the father of my son know that I was coming over to do laundry and so I ended up distracting him too much so he couldn't get to the gym before I had to go to work; overall that was not a very bad conversation, but still I felt so completely overwhelmed with thoughts of suicide. 
I open up to the father about it and he is shook and didn't even realize that, that is something I could be dealing with. I let him know I think I need inpatient care and I start looking. I make a couple calls and keeping hitting walls. My behavior starts to get worse and worse I am less and less engaged with my son and the father so the father tells me I need to get lawyer so we can get our arrangement settled so we can spend less time with each other and have our son on a schedule. I completely freak out in my mind. We talk I decide I want to go to the ER and hopefully they can get me to an Inpatient facility. 
5 days later I get out with no phone and very little TV time feeling all kinds of things that I haven't felt in so long... This was all about a week ago and ever since I have been in and out breaking down. I ended up telling the father that I need to leave and it hurt him so much but he ultimately is so understanding that I honestly feel as though I don't deserve it.
 
Anyways I left yesterday morning and last night spent the last part of the day sitting on the beach staring at the ocean dreaming of drowning in the ocean... I seriously cannot handle this life and the rollercoaster of emotions that I go through. I just want to feel peace again. I want to feel like I can connect with someone.

peonylove1031,"I never felt a connection with my second pregnancy. Wow, I have never openly admitted that. And I still don’t feel connected to my second born. Also something I have never admitted. I’m sad I even typed that. 

I’m now 4 months postpartum. I also have a 22 month old daughter- a ball of super high energy. My son (4 months) has bad reflux and colicky. I moved away from family to a new state. COVID killed my chance of making friends. Right now my husband is working 24/7 (like 60-70 hours a week). So here I am, in a new place, no family, no friends with 2 kids. I had baby blues with my first just because of the change. But my second. He is such a hard baby 😭 and I legit don’t know if I can handle it. He cries, I mean screams, all day. So I’m super frustrated. And then I’m like a shit mom cuz my daughter is on the back burner. 

Sleep? What’s that? My daughter fights sleep like I’ve never seen and she’s up most the night. Then it’s a back and forth between the kids all night long. One kid is up while the other is asleep. Then they are both up. I’m fighting them both back down, one falls asleep the other stays up. By the time I get that one to sleep the other is up. And I’m just like FUCK MY LIFE. 

I dread bedtime and I dread waking up for the next day. I don’t look forward to my days anymore. I’m so lonely. And when I talk to people al I get is advice! Like HELLO?! I’m not screaming for advice. I’m drowning. How about a hand to pull me out. A cry when I need one. A hug. Shit I’ll take a high five at this point. I’m so lonely. 

I started anti depressants a week ago along with anxiety pills. I’m hoping it uplifts me out of this dark hole I’m trapped in. I want to be a better mom. I don’t want to cry in a freezing cold shower just because I don’t give a shit, about anything. 

My husband is lovely. But he’s all like “be positive” that’s so much easier said then done. I’ve always been a positive person but I just can’t right now. I physically can’t even think one positive thought because I know I’ll get crushed as soon as I think it. Am I crazy?! I’ve completely lost it. 

Let me add, no way am I to the point of hurting myself or my kids. They are very much loved. I know I’ll get better and I know all my problems shall pass. But fuck, I’m so deep right now that I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.

WuzzyBubblu,"I’ve been having a hard time since my daughter was born. At 20 weeks they saw that she had a lump on her neck. They weren’t sure to what extent this would affect her so I was followed closely by the children’s hospital an hour away. As I got closer to my due date things looked good. She had a lump which they believed to be a lymphatic malformation buy her air way and lungs looked developed and open. They told me they would most likely take her to the NICU just to be monitored but they thought she would be fine. I felt a loss that I could not deliver naturally, could not do skin to skin, could not bring my baby right to the breast, could not delay cord clamping. There’s are all things I’ve always imagined happening at my birth. I’ve wanted a baby for a lot time but struggled with ovarian cysts. 
Literally 10 minutes before my scheduled c-section they came to tell me they’ve decided to intubated and sedate her just incase because the area around her lump could swell and cause her air way to be blocked. I argued that we should give her a chance and only intubated If there is sings of danger. They said it could be complicated to intubated after swelling happens. I ask if we could wait but sure intubated at the first sign of swelling, maybe she really didn’t need it. 
She came out screaming. A nice healthy loud cry. Definitely breathing. Within 5 minutes she was intubated and sedated and she stayed that way for 10 days. Because she was born on a Thursday and it took them a day to transfer her to the children’s hospital across the street from where I delivered. Then it was the weekend and the specialist weren’t around. They didn’t check her air way and clear it till the next Wednesday. Because they weren’t sure if her air way was affected no one could hold her in that time. The concerns I had were dismissed. I was worried about her getting addicted to the morphine and drugs she was on and was told babies don’t get addicted. Only to later be told she was psychically dependent on it. Guess that’s different to them. 
I couldn’t stay with her there and spent around 4000$ to stay in the area and be at the hospital everyday. I was totally checked out in order to deal with the stress and also felt completely invalidated as a mom. I felt like I had no autonomy at a parent. We were there for a whole week after she was off the meds and everything with them just monitoring her, no interventions.They made me prove I could take care of her before they would discharge her. They don’t do that to every mom. 
When I came home I questioned my self. I didn’t feel like I was able to take care of her. How do I know she’s okay if she didn’t have the monitors on her. They had me at the doctors 2-3 times a week for weight checks even tho she’s always been in the 40-50th percentile for weight. Making me feel even more incompetent. 
I just wanted someone to tell me “wow it seems that we created more problems then they’re need to be and that sucks” but all they could say was “don’t you want what’s safest for your kid”. 
I’m finally starting to feel some what better. I finally had the confidence to say I don’t like her doctors I’m looking for new ones and act on it. I feel much better with her new pediatrician who thinks her weight has been completely fine and looks to me for information on her health instead of assuming I don’t understand something. 
I’m talking to my own doctors. As you might know finding a new PCP and psych is a nightmare rn. But I’m doing it and I’m starting to feel okay. I still really want to have a day off and when I do get someone to watch her I realize I haven’t checked in on her. And wouldn’t a mom of a new born be worried and want to rush back? I don’t. And I feel bad about that stuff. But I also am recognizing that I’ve been through a lot and so much was out of my control. It’s going to take time to get back to normal. 
Just wanted to share with people who will understand. My family only point out that I haven’t been myself and comment that I should try to bond with her. They say well meaning but very unhelpful and sometimes hurtful things. I’ve been lurking and reading other peoples stories and relating so much to those feelings.

- I think you’re fine.

victoria-lisbeth,"When you asked how we were doing, I could have lied. I could have said it was all roses, and perfect, and the baby was great and we were great and why would it be any different? I could have given a bland, non committal answer. Oh, you know, usual baby stuff. Hell, I even could have told you to f*ck off and mind your own damn business. 

But I didn't  because my therapist has been encouraging me to be honest and share my struggles. Yes, I'm in therapy and taking meds, aren't you proud? Back on topic, I was honest. I shared that my baby was being incredibly fussy and crying more than usual. I shared what I thought it was. More importantly, I shared how my DH and I are struggling with it. The frustration in not being able to soothe him. The illogical certainty that he just hates us. The thoughts of just putting him down and walking away to sleep in the car to (hopefully please God) get some sleep. 

I told you how mom came over because I called her in tears and somehow choked out that I needed help (Therapist again) and it went against what every bone in my body was screaming: ""how weak to ask for help. It's not even been a full three weeks and you can't handle it already? Who decided that YOU should be a mom?""

Honestly wasn't expecting much from you. Maybe a that sucks and offer of help, or those empty platitudes people always give (""Its normal"", ""You'll get the hang of it""). I didn't expect you to give me the same advice over and over after I told you it didn't work. ""Gas drops every 3 hours with a feeding!"" I tried that. It didn't work. This did though. ""I'm telling you gas drops saved me with nephew!"" Great. Congrats. It isn't helping my baby.

And then you hit me with a series of dots and silence. Me, already feeling like absolute crap, immediately went to ""She's judging me. She doesn't think I'm a good mom either. She could take care of him way better than me."" After an hour of silence to my questions of what's wrong, you snap back with ""You don't have to keep brushing off advice when someone more experienced is trying to help you.""

First I was mortified, then I bawled (again, brain thinking yeah shes right) and now I'm just angrily tired. I didn't ask for your advice. I acknowledged it, said it didn't help and moved on. 

You know what though? Next time you ask how ya doing, I'm just going to ignore the sharing an and tell you to f*ck off instead if this is what sharing gets me.

grump_a_saurus,"I've had issues with mental health for about 12 years. The first few years were a big learning curve and it took about 4 or 5 to really get the help I needed. Since then, I pride myself on being self aware and always able to get the help I need before it becomes unmanageable. I see two therapists, one for general counseling and the other for PTSD. I see them each every other week so I meet with one counselor weekly. 

During pregnancy, my medication (lamictal) was not approved for use due to anxiety, only as a treatment for seizures which I do not have. So I had to get off of it. I tried meeting with a psychiatrist familiar with drugs and pregnancy but it took several months to schedule an appointment and I ended up having my baby early so they canceled the appointment. As soon as I was discharged I was put back on my medication but haven't felt any therapeutic effects from it yet. 

I've been watching my mood very closely for any changes. I'd honestly been feeling fantastic. I thought I had somehow managed to steer clear of PPD and PPA. Then all of a sudden, stressful, yet normal things would occur and I would be unable to calm down and would be excessively emotional. 

For instance, my short term disability check was finally approved on Thursday but for half the amount I was expecting. I totally lost it and had a full on meltdown. My baby spent her first 4 weeks in the NICU and I, mentally and emotionally, knew I could not go back to work after 6 weeks with only 2 of them having her home. I opted to take the full 12 weeks regardless of what they pay out. So when they chose to pay out half of the expected amount, I did not keep my cool. This I could understand and chose to give myself grace for the outburst. Anyone would have been upset. 

My next issue revolved around breastfeeding and pumping. I've had a low supply. The NICU situation made breastfeeding a challenge. I had been getting only 4 oz total a day for about 2 weeks. I purchased a Haakaa silicone pump and was able to double my supply in only 3 days with half the time it had been taking me to pump. I was thrilled, in less pain, and singing the Haakaa's praises far and wide. On day 4 I noticed a rash on my breasts and day 5 I was itching constantly head to toe. Went to the doctor, and low and behold, I am allergic to silicone. A very rare allergy. The allergy gets worse as you are exposed so that's why it didn't pop up immediately even though I'd been using a silicone nipple shield to breastfeed since week 2. But now I break out in hives when it touches my skin for a prolonged period. So I had to stop using the Haakaa, and I had to stop pumping and breastfeeding because of the hives on my actual nipples. Now my supply has dried up because I was hardly getting enough in the first place. So that led feelings of powerlessness and failure. Again, I was upset and disappointed, but it felt reasonable given the circumstances.

The most recent issue was my gift registry thank you notes. I became obsessive in getting them out. I worked tirelessly on them and wrote personal detailed notes and they were perfection. I had one or two I had questions on and when I asked my mom about them, I guess I was being imposing and she yelled at me and this sent me spiralling out of control. I have cried every waking hour since that phone call yesterday morning. I cannot calm down, the tears will not stop. No amount of logic is enough to stem the flow of tears. I have less patience with my child. I cannot handle multiple pressing tasks at once. I am overstimulated and completely overwhelmed. This is nothing I've ever experienced before. 

I recognize that this is very out of the norm for me so I scheduled an emergency OB appointment and the doctor diagnosed me with severe PPD and told me I needed another 6 weeks off work to allow for the medication to begin working. She prescribed zoloft on top of my lamictal. 

Part of me is so relieved for the diagnosis because my main stressor is money and I was planning to take the full 12 weeks anyway, but since PPD is a disability, now I can take the time off paid. So now I feel guilty that I feel relieved that I have a PPD diagnosis. 

Everything is off though. Nothing looks right or feels right and it's only been for about a week that things have really changed. It's nothing I've ever felt before and I thought I was a pro at knowing myself and my moods. This hit me like a ton of bricks and surprised me even though I was actively looking for it.

Since I've only had one since giving birth, my hormones are still leveling out, and with how intense the PPD has been, it would make sense that my periods wouldn't be regular right now, right?

At night, it’s very hard for me to actually wake up to her crying (I actually incorporate them into my dreams sometimes 😭), and when I do, it seems to trigger me a lot. I get very anxious/frustrated/overwhelmed, and it’s becoming increasingly hard for me to respond to her at night, and it’s taking longer for me to be able to because I just seem to panic when she cries. I’ll literally cover my ears for a minute to have a minute of quiet before I respond. I’ll take a minute to walk away and calm down, and then not want to come back. 😔 I try to get my husband up so someone can tend to her, but I just feel horrible and like I’m going to cause psychological damage to my child.

I am not like this during the day; I normally get up and feel awful about it. I’m actually horrified that I’m having such a hard time at night and that sometimes she cries more because of it. I don’t know if it’s maybe my body reacting to the sleep deprivation? Or if I’m just a bad mom.

I’m in a constant cycle of toxic arguments with my husband for at times feels like for no reason. I feel like the person I am most patient with is my baby, although there are nights where I want to cry because she won’t fall asleep, and I wish I could just press a button to turn her sleep mode “on” My irritation towards my partner and uncontrollable things in the world is off the charts. I hold grudges now—something I didn’t before and at night when I’m feeding the baby I’ll cry remembering all those shitty times we’ve argued. I’ve been told that most of the stuff that comes out of my mouth sounds negative..like a complaint or a problem and I don’t know how to change that. I’m afraid this will be permanently hurting my marriage. 

I feel like I’m slowly drifting away from the person I was, and also the lack of sleep does not help at all. On a good night I’ll sleep 3 hour spurts on a bad, 2. I’m not intimate with my husband, most of the times I have an aversion towards anyone that is not the baby.

My daughter is a little over 2 months old. She is a healthy 14 lbs .7 oz, she is always smiling, she is happy, she sleeps 6 hours at night, she is thriving. She barely ever fusses or cries. By the book she is perfect and I'm very blessed beyond belief. She is also strictly FORMULA FED. *gasp*

I still get looks of disdain from grown women, even doctors, when I tell them she is formula fed. My experience with breastfeeding was not fun. She had trouble latching, and even though we tried every position in the book, neither of us could get it to ""feel right"". 10 minutes in and we would both end up sweaty, frustrated, and in tears. Some of the lactation specialists that I saw in the hospital almost made me feel like supplementing with formula wasn't even an option I should consider. And every handout given to me only directed me towards breastfeeding. So when my infant was screaming in hunger, I was over ridden with guilt at the thought of formula feeding her. Constantly hearing ""It's 2020 and breast Is best."" I didn't even feel comfortable giving it a shot. But when I realized I can't starve my baby, I tried a combo of pumping AND supplementing... however, being chained to a milking machine just wasn't my jam. Sore nipples, fussing with machinery in the middle of the night, and let's be real - pumping bras can be a nightmare.

But here we are 2 months later and I'm here to let any curious new momma know, that FED IS BEST. If your baby is fed and thriving, and you are happy, please please please disregard any guilt you have about deciding not to breastfeed. And absolutely whatever reason you have for it, is VALID so long as your precious little babe is taken care of. Don't second guess your own mommy instincts like I did because ""the books say..."". Do what is comfortable and best for you and baby. You will know what feels right and what feels comfortable for you both is top priority. 

I have such a newfound respect and sincere love for all mamas since having her. I send my love and positive vibes for any of you struggling with this and feeling like a ""bad mom"" like I did because breastfeeding wasn't working out.",Postpartum_Depression,Anti momshaming post: a message about breastfeeding and PPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/huvk8u/anti_momshaming_post_a_message_about/,1595310162.0,2020-07-20 22:42:42,6.712612882709105e+18

redirectibly,"I’m sitting here, furious w/my partner and breastfeeding for the thousandth time at 2am, and I haven’t seen a lick of sleep yet.

I’m so SO tired and done and just plain overwhelmed and I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I had a really traumatic birth/postpartum experience. I was in the hospital a week before she came, she was early and in the NICU and then I was separated from her and my husband and wasn’t allowed to see either of them. We finally got her home, and then I had a massive postpartum hemorrhage and had to go through all of that alone.

Cut to here, where I started BC and my milk supply has dropped and my 2 month old is frustrated and wanting to eat all the time, my husband just tore into me for having an attitude because I’m struggling with it. All while he can go back to sleep and ignore everything and doesn’t have to worry about making sure he’s making enough food to keep his daughter alive. That, and just the fact that he gets sleep at all just kind of makes me mad right now.

I’m just struggling so much. She doesn’t let me put her down during the day, so I can’t sleep when she sleeps. Then when my husband gets home, I’m cleaning because I can’t exist in a messy house.

I’m just TIRED and my anxiety is through the roof and I have so much rage and I’m so stressed and oh, I’m also completely alone because of COVID and we have no family that lives closer than 5 hours away. I don’t know what to do, but I’m miserable and I just need to get all of this out.

I would never hurt her or put her in a position to be hurt, but I don't feel motherly. I go through the motions of caring for her, doing what is necessary-feedings, bathings, clothing, shopping, but I wish I were doing anything else. I only want to go back to work to get away from her. And I think she senses it too. When I try to hold her, she pulls away like she knows I'm not right. I just want to run away and disappear most days. I go shopping a lot just to get away for a few hours. This pandemic isn't helping because I can't go anywhere for a release. I have limited interactions with people. I try to make her stay up as late as possible so she can wake up late in the mornings around 11-1130am so by the time my mom gets home around 12-1215pm that she is bathed and fed and she can deal with her. I don't have the strength mentally to deal with her. I'll put her in the playpen or playroom with her toys and only check on her to change or feed her. I know that's terrible, but at least I know she's safe. I feel she'd be better off without me because I know I am not good at this. I need help but I don't have it so I suffer silently.

I love him to pieces but also I can’t cope with him all the time. I feel really guilty constantly because I feel like I’m not taking care of him properly and I’m failing him as a mother. Because of this every time I’ve been out recently I’ve drank way too much like an idiot. It’s the only way I can seem to escape feeling so alone and helpless but then I always feel worse because I’m failing him even more by turning to alcohol. I feel like I’m spiralling and I have no idea what to do. Before baby alcohol was my main coping mechanism but now it can’t be yet I can’t seem to let go and find something else. It’s causing major problems in my life as I keep ruining my relationship with my partner. We now fight everyday and often in public around our friends.

But I dont get to enjoy it,im just slipping more and more into my PPD.

The relationship I have with my sons father, if it was not for my son I would have zero contact with him.
He has verbally abused me the entire pregnancy and up to this day, there is around three treaths a week that ""I need to watch it"" and ""there will be consequences"". 

He manipulates every single counselour we have met,he even managed to manipulate my friends and family, but they saw how he really is. He went on the whole entire pregnancy telling me that its not his son,he did not want anything with him,I could forget about child support and forcing my son to give a DNA test.
When I was 20 weeks pregnant I had the big ultrasound,there I got the choice to choose between my son or his father because all the stress was putting my son in danger. Up to this day,his dad still chews my ass for pulling me and my unborn son away so we could rest. Even then he would not stop.

He still makes things miserable,one day he wants his son the next he dont. He gets to see his son one hour a week ,I have offered more and he still says no just to complain that he gets too little. I dont understand him at all. Ive said my fair share of stupid things,but im trying to do better for my son so I only talk to his dad once a week to schedule the hourly visit.

Ive talked to cps,my sons doctor and a lawyer,there is nothing I can do. I talked to my shrink that I wanted to start antidepressants just to numb everything out.
I cant give my son the love he needs and deserves,somedays I get these fits where I dont even recognize my own son. The only positive thing is that I finally love my son,it sounds horrible but I have not been able to bond with him.

My son screams and cries when he sees his dad,he has zero connection to him. I try my best but I dont have any more in me. Ive become a shell, im so disconnected from it all. Some days I wish my son wasnt born because he deserves better.  I feel horrible,I feel like ive failed as a mother.

MammaSOEJ,"I am posting this to see if anyone else have had similar experiences after having their baby.  

About two years ago, my husband and I were discussing if we should have another baby or opt for permanent sterilization.  I was pretty much good with the three we already had and so was he, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I would be sad if we could never have another baby.  I did a lot of waffling back and forth whether we should try for another baby or go ahead with him getting a vasectomy.  What we finally agreed on was that we would try for the rest of the year (it was about August or so if I remember right) and if we didn't get pregnant, we would call it quits.  I got pregnant soon after.  I remember feeling nothing for this baby.  I was so excited when I learned I was pregnant with all my other kids that I felt guilty about not feeling anything about this one.  I knew I was pregnant early on (about 4 weeks along) because I started to get nauseous.  I put off making any prenatal appointments because I figured I've done this before - there's not much the doctor is going to say/do that would surprise me.  I finally saw the doctor and saw the baby in January.  I still felt nothing.  A part of me didn't want to go through pregnancy and having a little one totally dependent on me again.  And I think I regretted a bit about conceiving her.  Happily, I finally started to fall in love with my child.  It happened so much later in the pregnancy - about half way through - but I was so glad I was starting to warm up to the idea of being a new mom again.  Baby girl was born in July.  This is where things get weird.

A few nights after we came home, I was sitting in her room rocking her when I heard footsteps in the hallway.  It sounded like someone was walking down the hall.  These were not the usual house noises, these were footsteps.  After I put baby to bed, I checked on the kids' room (they all sleep in the same room) and the door was firmly closed, nobody was in the bathroom.  I asked my husband if he had gotten up.  He said no.  That was a little hard to explain to myself but maybe it was because I was too tired.  A few days later, baby and I were alone in the house (hubby was trying to keep the older kids busy so I could have some alone time).  I was in the living room reading when I heard a crash in the kitchen.  I got up to check it out but didn't see anything that could have fallen.  I even checked to see where the cat was in case she was the culprit - she was curled up sleeping.  Weird, but maybe something fell and I just couldn't find it.  Another night and baby can't sleep.  She keeps crying so I'm out in the living room so we don't disturb my husband who has to work the next day.  The lights are on low and I'm sitting reading again (btw, Kindle unlimited was my bff the first 3 months after having baby) and I heard a ball bouncing.  My mother-in-law had gotten them those big bouncy balls with a handle that they can sit on and bounce around the house.  Two of them were next to the sofa.  I looked over and they're just sitting there.  I heard one bouncing though.  I wonder if the air vent would have been able to push one away ... but how would it have been able to make it bounce?  Then I thought maybe we have mice and one happened to brush by one of the balls.  We keep the cat in the basement at night so I know it wasn't her.  I chalked it up to being tired again (though I've never had anything like that happen before).  Anywho a few more days pass.  My husband takes the kids to a football game across the street and it's just me and baby again.  She had just fallen asleep so I put her down and watched some youtube videos.  I have my headphones on - slightly askew so I can hear baby if she cries.  Suddenly I hear a little girl's voice.  I know for sure it wasn't through youtube, and though I didn't catch most of what the little girl was saying, I did catch my daughter's name. (Yes, she was talking about my daughter!)  A little freaked out, I immediately grab my sleeping daughter and hold her while we wait for everyone else to come home. I looked up ""hearing things postpartum"" and came up with postpartum psychosis.  My daughter will be one in July and after hearing the strange little girl's voice, I haven't heard anything since.  I wonder if I had a very mild psychosis?  I wonder if my not wanting to be pregnant at the start of my pregnancy had anything to do with it?  I wonder if anyone else had anything similar happen?  I noticed with all of these strange things happening that they were all auditory.  I didn't ever see anything.  So strange.",Postpartum_Depression,Hearing Things?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/hithsy/hearing_things/,1593568083.0,2020-06-30 18:48:03,1.6292793514063647e+19
wrongfrench,"First off, I’m so in love with my baby girl, but starting with a hellacious traumatic 56 hour labor with 2 failed epidurals, it seems nothing is going right. We got her home after a few extra days in the hospital, and started to adjust to our new normal.. first few days went ok until we found out her weight had dropped tremendously thanks to flat nipples and a bad latch. No worries, I could pump and supplement with a bottle of my own milk and she was starting to get the hang of the nipple shield. My partner and I have been at odds with one another thanks to no support (thanks covid) and no sleep. We often end up cussing each other out at 3 am over some dumb thing. Fast forward a few weeks and cluster feeding starts, this I thought must be the worst thing we would have to endure, she wouldn’t sleep and just wanted to be on a boob every 30 mins for 3-6-12 hours. Then it passes after a few days, ah finally she’s sleeping for 2-3 hours between feeds. Then a few days ago I woke up at 4am with every single joint in screaming pain and shivering plus a serious headache. I thought I must have the flu, next day my boob is fire hot and red and hard. Urgent care says yep, mastitis here’s some antibiotics (my 5th in 3 weeks thanks to group B strep, chorioamnitis developed in labor, then a uti right after I got home). Still haven’t gotten relief from the mastitis yet but the last 24 hours it seems baby girl has developed colic symptoms likely from drinking milk with antibiotics in it. I’ve reached a level of self loathing that my partner can’t really handle, I’m sobbing all the time and really wondering why I thought I could handle being a mom. I know that it’s not my fault but I just hate feeling like I cant give her what she needs over and over again, I hate letting her down already at just 3 weeks old. Phew.

beingsmomishard,"This is hard for me to put into words but I am struggling to know if how I feel is normal

My son is 11 months old now and I don’t think I have enough of the symptoms to really think I have ppd and probably this entire lock down quarantining is just exacerbating my feelings but everything just feels so hard

I love my son so much but I really struggle to feel like I am enough. My husband and I are constantly arguing usually due to how he doesn’t realize how the things he says make me feel. I work full time from home and throughout the quarantine he has taken on the role of the nanny/stay at home Dad. Once I am done work for the day my son is usually napping and so I start with his dinner and breastfeed and play with him when he wakes up, I feed him his dinner and if the weather is nice my husband takes him out for a walk for 45 minutes usually. And I am so exhausted at the end of the day. Then my husband will sometimes complain that I don’t do “anything”. If the kitchen is a mess after I’ve made dinner and I don’t clean it he will tell me that I have no respect for him and he has even told me that he’s spoken to his mother and brother and friends and they all agree I should be doing more. But sometime, really a lot of the time I just don’t feel like I can. I know it’s not fair to leave the mess for him but I also know he isn’t working and so it feels sort of fair to en that he handles the cleaning. For the first time since he has started eating solids a few days ago I felt so sick with a headache and just dizzy that I couldn’t handle giving him his dinner so I asked him to do it. And I broke down crying after because I just felt so guilty that I didn’t take care of him and that I let him do the job that has always been my responsibility. 

Some days I just wake up dreading having to do anything, not wanting to have to take care of my son because he is so much work and has been so cranky and I feel so so guilty like I am a terrible mother because I just want a break.

postpartumpoopoo,"So I'm 2 weeks away from returning from maternity leave to the workplace. They have permitted me to WFH. 

My partner works on an ""on-call"" basis and my original childcare was meant to be a 70 year old woman so that's fallen through. So I've had a huge battle with work to be flexible with my shifts but also to try and maintain my pay because they refuse to apply for furlough. 

It's been a war. It's involved the union and on top of my already miserable days struggling with PPD I've got work related stress and anxiety. 

Finally, my union rep and the head of our business sector came up with a solution that was highly beneficial to me. I'd work 7 days a week (fine), 6.30pm-10pm which made up most of my contracted hours, and the rest of my contracted hours would be ""special paid leave"".

Amazing, I thought. 

My kid is almost 12 months old, and we made the decision to continue breastfeeding as allergies have come to light with recent weaning meaning food is limited, especially seen as shops are usually bare by the time we get there. There's also almost never any formula and I'd hate to buy it when my breasts do produce milk when there are mothers struggling to get it and might have no supply, triplets and might just be worse off than I am right now. We also cannot for love nor money get any whole milk. There's a fuck tonne of semi skimmed or skimmed milk, but no whole and 12 month olds need whole milk. 

I also can't get along with a pump. I'm a part time breastfeeding peer support volunteer, I am highly trained, I can help with almost all breastfeeding issues and the irony is that pumping just has never really worked for me. I suspect it's something to do with the PPD, lack of oxytocin being produced while pumping etc etc, but for that reason I can only really get my baby to take milk directly from the breast.

So imagine my joy when all of my worries about how my child is going to stay sustained fell through when my manager said they refuse to acknowledge paid special leave, that they'll ad-hoc my shifts but also told me that I can't have any distractions including from children because it's a customer facing role. 

I have gone back to my union but it's like shoveling shit in a farmyard. It just doesn't stop. This stress is relentless and I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. I spend all day crying, then getting super motivated to fight this, then cry some more and realise there's not much I can do to win here. 

If I decide to just quit, I have to pay back my company maternity pay which has been spent. Long gone. I have no money to give back, and the thought of fighting that battle just scares me more. 

I asked my union to just push for furlough on the grounds of needing childcare and she said that if I were furloughed, which my workplace have already refused to do, that I'd lose my ""death-in-service"" benefits for my family. She said that as I'm overweight and in a vulnerable category that it wasn't sensible to push for furlough. That just made me even more scared. 

Honestly all of this is just getting to me.",Postpartum_Depression,I think my workplace are going to be the end of me,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/g4c4hl/i_think_my_workplace_are_going_to_be_the_end_of_me/,1587344261.0,2020-04-19 17:57:41,9.135143716551402e+18

The Price We May Pay

&amp;#x200B;

You don’t know what you’re asking of me—  
what it was like for me, when 2 became 3.

&amp;#x200B;

When I became a shadow that hated itself.  
My black-hued, opaque face — spiritless,  
unable to display or exude  
the proper amounts of joy and gratitude  
expected to accompany the miracle of life.

&amp;#x200B;

I slowly shrank into myself,  
everyday as the sun rose high in the sky,  
leaving me withered, parched and sucked dry.  
A sliver of darkness underfoot,  
wondering if today I wouldn’t survive,  
wouldn’t magically reappear as the sun sunk low.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I’m better now….

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It’s been a few years….

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But…

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You’ve been urging for 3 to become 4  
and I don’t know if I can handle any more.  
What if even the shadow disappears?  
Gone for good at high noon one day…

danihaydu,"I want to start out by saying how much I love my son. I’m crying as I type this because I think of his blonde hair, his piercing blue eyes and his gorgeous smile. He is my best friend.

I am currently laying in bed, I have been crying all morning. I was helping my boyfriend measure our crib this morning.. I set my son down on the bed and looked away. As I looked back, he was falling off the bed, in slow motion. I couldn’t believe my eyes, I screamed and ran. I couldn’t face the fact I had let my baby fall off the bed. I ran upstairs, broke down on the floor and began to sob. My boyfriend came up the stairs with my son, and I grabbed a cup full of coffee and smashed it on the ground while saying how I can’t do this anymore. In that moment I just wanted to die. 

I lost my mom a year and a half ago to suicide. I miss her more than words can even describe. I feel like my life is becoming slowly more empty as my son gets older because I don’t have my moms guidance. I feel like I am slowly breaking down. 

I hear phantom screams when I’m in the shower, I turn the nozzle off to make sure I’m just dreaming. I shoot awake at night to check my son hasn’t died. I obsess over checking on my son during naps to make sure he’s breathing. I mush his food into paste to make sure he isn’t going to choke and die. I have dreams of my boyfriend carrying him down the stairs, tripping and accidentally killing my son. 

I’m breaking down.

I sometimes wonder if my moms path will be mine. I’m sick of seeing moms on social media make it look so easy, it’s hard, it’s draining and it’s slowly eating away at me.

j_grantham94,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a FTM to a 2 month old baby girl. Recently, I've figured out that I have PPD. I don't think it was too bad upfront, but the virus and lock down really haven't helped. It's so hard to do things I enjoy, as most things I like doing are shut down. 

Anyway, I've noticed lately that it's really hard for me to enjoy my husband in a physical way. I still find him attractive, he has been incredibly supportive, he helps take care of the baby, he does things around the house, he is still working, so overall, he is amazing. However, I just can't find myself wanting to have sex with him. It's not just that, I have no interest in sex at all. I almost feel like my brain is telling me I'd be a bad mom if I have sex.. which doesn't make sense, but ya know, depression....

I talked to my husband a little bit about this and explained how I just don't feel good about myself as my body has changed so much. I also explained that I want to take things slow since I'm still healing and sex still hurts. 

I just don't want to scare myself into thinking this will last forever and put off having sex with my husband forever. I just want to get back to my old self, and I just don't know what steps to take?

postpartumpoopoo,"I'm coming to the end of my 12 month maternity leave and the loss of freedom has been a struggle. 

There have been days we've been on the sofa, with nursery rhymes on repeat, while my baby naps and if I try to set them down they just crawl back on up. 

There are days where I can't even catch a break to get a drink and I end up with dehydration headaches than painkillers just don't quell. 

My partner is currently WFH, (as will I, soon) and he can see I'm absolutely fried on his breaks. I can't get away from my baby, and I just want him to come and take this kid off me for 5 minutes but he goes to the bathroom and gets a drink and I sit there growing resentment that I wish I could do those things. 

I'd usually leave my son to cry for 5 minutes every so often while I looked after myself but now my partner is working from home and talking to customers I can't do that. 

In some ways my partner's life has changed but he doesn't understand that I feel trapped. I've tried telling him I feel trapped and his responses were:

* You can go for a walk if you want
*You can do the weekly shop this week if you'd like
* Hop in the bath, but don't be too long. 

I don't enjoy going for walks, I don't enjoy doing the food shop, I don't want to sit in a bath that I'm not even afforded the time to enjoy. A bath isn't a hobby, but I've not had my own time for so long that I just don't even know what I enjoy doing any more. 

I've had a lot of stress about work, and them enabling me to work from home because there's no childcare available to me. It involved the union and to be honest it's still not resolved, which has left me worrying about money too as well as fighting for my right to keep my family safe which means MORE isolation. 

I honestly feel like I'm missing this huge part of my personality but I can't remember what it was like to try and get it back.

I wish I could have some kind of lobotomy so I could just crack on with it without feeling all of these feelings. I just want to wake up without despairing about the groundhog day that is Infront of me for the foreseeable future.

cheyennegg,"Has this happened with anyone else? We had a great relationship up until the time she was born. He doesn’t seem interested in her. He’s been home for the past week and will be for another and all he’s done is play video games. He only speaks to me to communicate that she needs fed, etc. 

He hasn’t been affectionate at all towards me. He has been towards her which I am grateful for and I think he will be a great dad no matter what happens with us. I know hormones and whatnot but I feel like I just know it’s done between us.

He seemed just shocked at the birthing process and then I can hardly blame him for not seeing me the same way with dripping nipples and watching all kinds of wonderful things come out when I had her. He doesn’t even wanna cuddle with me, doesn’t kiss me, hasn’t hugged me. He hasn’t even told me that he loves me since I’ve had her and I just thought he would’ve reacted different after I had his firstborn...

throwaway_ppd1,"Our daughter is 7 months old. My wife has a history of depression before pregnancy and after our baby arrived it came back in force.

She has been going to therapy and has seen a psychiatrist for medication.

 I am at work most of the day and she is at home. We also live at my mother in laws house. A usual day I will get up for work before both are awake and kiss them goodbye.

DD usually wakes up around 8am, and my wife will sometimes get up and take care of her but most of the time she texts her mom to come get the baby and she goes back sleep.

On good days she will get up around 10 or 11 and hang out with grandma and baby. Grandma does a lot of the feedings, diapers, and keeping little one entertained.

On bad days she won't get out of bed until afternoon, sometimes she has been in bed when I get home around 4pm.

When I get home I play with daughter, feed her, change her when she needs it. Around 8 or 9 I put her to bed. Then wife and I hang out then go to sleep. 

I don't know how to help my wife, she doesn't want to do much with daughter. She loves her and likes to hold her when she sleeps and when she does play with her it breaks my heart seeing the two of them so happy because I wish it was always like that.

My wife has told me she doesn't want to be a mom anymore on bad days, most days she says she doesn't feel any connection. But then there are also good days and she really is a great mom.

I don't know what else to do, if medication and therapy aren't working what can I do? I try to be helpful with daughter,  give her space when she needs it, take her out on dates just the two of us.

Teacher_Shark,"Little one is three weeks old today and while I love her to pieces, I sometimes don't feel a bond with her. Sometimes I look at her and my heart melts or she'll cry and I just have a surging need to go to her and love her and care for her. Other times, I feel so distant and detached from her and have no desire to interact. I don't cry alot, mostly because I won't let myself, but I nearly constantly feel like I could cry. I feel like I'm failing as a mom. Last night the idea popped into my head that she would be just fine if I left her with her father and just disappeared. I haven't had thoughts of hurting myself or her, just that she and my husband would be better off without me in the picture.

I think some of this stems from the fact my husband practically had to raise his two nephews in high school and already knows how to take care of our daughter. And I don't think he means to, but sometimes he comes off as annoyed when I struggle with doing something or don't know how to do something for her. This doesn't help with the whole ""failing as a mom"" thing. 

He also kept telling me and my family that we were holding her too much and would spoil her, practically from the time she was born. My parents of course ignored him, but I struggle to do that and listened to him. I now feel like I missed out on crucial bonding time in the first week or so by only holding her when feeding her or if she was actively crying. Now I rarely want to just sit and hold her, and I barely got the experience of just sitting, holding, and staring lovingly at this little human I made. This makes me even sadder.

throwawayf0rreasons3,"Trigger warning: rape, suicide, and abuse mentions.


So when i had become pregnant with my daughter it was from being raped by my boyfriend at the time. He was abusive and raping me was one of his ways of hurting me. I had become pregnant before from this, but miscarried very early. I had planned on getting an abortion or putting my kid for adoption after she was born, but my mom (been my main abuser since i was a baby) threatened to kill me if i did those things. I had left my ex (even though he was stalking me) and had to move back in with my parents. I was 19 with no college experience and little work history (i had planned to get away from my abusive family and going to college then). I wasn't ready, and even though being abused almost daily and my life constantly being on the line is not a good excuse to bring a child into that life I did. 
My daughter was born and i had alot of mixed feelings. I loved her, but i was also so very scared (ex showed up at the hospital. I kept the where and when secret and only told close friends, yet he showed up). I usually became agitated when my daughter cried. My family became more abusive towards me and included my daughter in it ( throwing me around the house, locking me in the garage if i tried to leave the house with my daughter, screaming at my daughter, neglecting her if i was working till id come home to her with a bloody rash because they wanted me to quit my job. After i quit it got worse to the point where they stole all my savings and would withhold money and formula if my kid needed it. Would eat all our food to starve us,trying to give my infant daughter beer cause they thought it was funny. and i was the only one cleaning and being beaten if there was a mess. Just alot of abuse) then with my ex still stalking me trying to get me alone. I became very depressed and thought things would be better if me and my daughter died. It was that mentality while trying to find work,working for like 3 weeks, then quitting because i couldn't afford buying food for my daughter (that my family would either eat or throw away) and a proper daycare while trying to find a lawyer cause my family forged some papers to take him to court for child support. (They filled it out in my name and then threatened our lives if i didn't take him to court)..... We got out of my parents house after my daughter turned 1 but a year after that i got kicked out of my home and moved back in with my dad (parents had divorced) we shared a room with my little brother and his girl friend. My daughter had a play pen to sleep in and i had an air mattress that later turned into a broken futon. My brother and his girlfriend eventually purposefully broke my daughter's playpen and had their new cats pee and spray in it. I had to throw it away. Then i moved in with my mom cause the abuse wouldn't stop. It got worse there. She brought my ex over and left him,me, and my daughter alone. He waited till my daughter fell asleep and then tried to assault me in the same room. I pushed him off me and he left....

I would be lying if i didn't say that i attempted suicide a lot. My last attempt was last year in may. Its been over a year since ive lived with my family. And looking back at my emotions i was not in a healthy place and was very selfish to put my daughter through that with me.  Things aren't perfect yet. I tried to put my daughter up for adoption so i could give her a chance at a better life, but my ex took me to court. 
So our situation currently is... Ive left my family, cut my mother out of my life and only let my family on when i want them (i don't let myself be their door mat.)  I lost my job because of the Covid-19, but im also applying for college to get in in august or even January. I go to therapy and parenting classes and i have my daughter in therapy as well. My ex is sadly apart of our lives and he wont 3 days of being alone with my daughter. (So she is stuck alone with my rapist for 3 days) legally cant do anything unless my ex rapes me again in front of my daughter or he hurts her.( my lawyer told me this) but i have always taught her agency and that it is not okay for someone to invade her space and that when she says no to anything it means no. People need to ask her before they hug her and she has a choice to say no. Also that it os not okay for someone to touch her privates unless its to help her wash,get dressed, or go potty. And only mommy and her teacher with getting dressed.

Basically i found that alot of my PPD was because i was in an abusive environment and had a very bad past to where i don't know what a mothers love is nor how to be a loving parent.. Im in therapy now and it helps bundles. Things are not perfect now, but one step at a time we are getting there. 
Alot of my ppd was my fear of failing her and letting her grow up as i had. And though ive failed her now and then im doing my best to keep her safe and i wont let her ever go through what i had. I will never let her be hurt by them again. 
I'm sorry that this is a mess and a big jumble of words, but i needed to vent and reassure myself and maybe hope that im not alone on the ""fear of failing"" thing.

TruthHurts17,"Not all the time. Some are just not getting the support they need. More to come, on this topic. I welcome your thoughts, respectfully. My initial ideas on problems that contribute to postpartum depression are...
1. There are still businesses that do not give fathers/partners paid time off after a new baby. This is when new moms need the MOST support. 
2. Social constructs play a huge in role in making it difficult for couples to have/raise kids in general. Both parents can rarely stay home. Someone has to bring in money and someone has to watch the kids. Both parents can work but they would need to bring in enough money to pay for someone else to care for the children for, probably, most of one paycheck. Unless you’re super rich. Then never mind. 
3. Many social media and TV/movie moms make it look so easy. But it’s not. It’s really hard to be a mother. But nobody really sees that very much and so a lot of fathers/partners just assume that it’s all going to be fine. But when it’s not, It’s a huge disappointment for everyone.

I wouldn’t trade my daughter for anything and she is the love of my life but sometimes I don’t know how much longer I can do this. The thought of doing this for 18 more years is so depressing for me. I wanted this baby. While I was pregnant I was over the moon about becoming a mom and now...

I want to make very, very clear that I have had zero thoughts about harming myself or my baby. I was under the impression that PPD, PPA, etc. was just feeling sad, depressed, suicidal, so on. I had no idea that it could also be the feelings I was having. I was just wondering if anyone else experienced more anger and rage rather than sadness. Because I can recognize my behavior and moods, it’s in turn making me a little upset. I’m also upset it was never brought to my attention that the way I’m feeling could be PPD until I had done some extensive reading on some in depth symptoms of PPD on my own.

momdreams4,"Hello! Moderators please let me know if this is not allowed.

I had a really difficult transition into Motherhood including Postpartum Depression. My experience was so terrible to the point I was extremely suicidal. I feel like I did so much preparation for the pregnancy and labor, but spent no time preparing for what comes after. I thought a postpartum doula would be unnecessary and only hired a labor doula. I also didn't set any boundaries and allowed visitors right away. I hated being a mom. I didn't bond with my baby right away. I felt guilty, selfish, and extremely lost. It took a lot of soul work, therapy, tapping back into my spirituality, and time to get better. I just look back and think like Wow there was so much I didn't know and so many things I wish I could do differently. I have dedicated my life now to help other women who are going through what I did.  


I don't necessarily have any programs up yet, but I vision having a Postpartum Coaching business or online program soon. I am conducting this survey to see what mothers really are seekings for to create the best possible program for them. I just really believe that there is such a need to help mothers transition into motherhood.

She prescribed 50 mg Zoloft.  I took the first dose around noon today and shortly after felt  very dizzy and groggy.  Problem is— I’m on mat leave and the caretaker for my son during the day, so these side effects freaked me out because caring for a newborn when drowsy is unbelievably hard (on top of the sleep deprivation I’ve already got).  Thank goodness my dad was here to entertain my son so I could lay down for a few minutes, but he leaves tomorrow.  I understand the side effects are temporary but that still doesn’t make it any easier.

OB recommended trying 25 mg first, and I might try the dose at night.

However, I feel like such a burden to my husband. Like any time I experience any sense of anxious energy, he is very frustrated with me and I start to feel even crazier. Like maybe I'm a burden.

Suddenly it's that as though I don't handle things well but I rarely show much emotion at all around him because I fear he thinks I'm a head case if I even cry. Like today I cried for the first time about how quickly my daughter is growing bc she's 6 months today and me just crying caused him to lose his patience with me.

ladysadi,"My baby is 9 days old today. I never found out the gender because I was so terrified of having a boy that I thought going through the pregnancy ignorant of the gender would allow me time to get attached and not care by the time delivery came along. 
Baby came in an unexpected way and I ended up with induction and c-section. Both of which were top of my list of fears. Thankfully I got my healthy baby girl and she's absolutely beautiful! In the beginning when I was in the hospital I felt like I was mostly normal mood wise. A day or so after arriving home the depression kicked in. It's still early so I'm not sure if this is true PPD or baby blues. It's intense though.
My husband has been amazing. He knows none of this is my fault and he's been as available as possible when I need to just talk even if he's heard it all before. My mom is also here but she's one of those ""mind over matter"" people despite being a nurse who should know better than to tell someone with depression to just be strong.
It's hard for me to be in the quiet. I can't look at the baby book, some of the decorations I spent hours making for her room, the playlist of Disney lullabies I used to listen to when I was pregnant, and sometimes even looking at the photos from the hospital. That all makes me cry. It feels like I'm mourning her growing up before it's ever happened. I miss being pregnant and having her with me all the time. I'm so in love with her and my husband. I feel like I can't get close enough or spend enough time with either of them. I feel like that part is normal. But is it normal to miss the newborn days before they are gone?

I'm a little ashamed I ended up being the first in the family to get a C-section. But those are nothing compared to what I just described.

Obscuremuir,"Hi I'm new here! 
 I'm two months post partum and yesterday I was diagnosed with PPD with previous diagnosed depression and anxiety. We pretty much knew as soon as I got pregnant that PPD was going to be a thing. I was severely depressed my entire pregnancy, bad thoughts, you name it. 
I wanted to be as preventative as I could. I went to counseling before I gave birth and put my name on a list for PPD care/services. I've done exercising, vitamin upping, vitamin D, sunshine etc but I suppose it wasn't good enough. I'm by no means the worst of the worst but I scored very high on my PPD test and the nurse was very worried.
When my son cries sometimes I just hold him and zone out. My husband noticed this the other day, weirded him out. It was like I shut off.
I feel like I failed my husband and son because I should have prevented it, but how do you prevent a mental I? 
I'm relieved that I have an explanation so now I can do something about it.

wartimeready,I am a husband who cares (probably too much) about my wife. She said she has been going through PPD for 15 months since she gave birth to our daughter and had her tubes removed. It has led to affecting her libido and I don't know what to do to help her. I tell her all the time I am still attracted to her the same way I was 5 years ago. I help push her to go to the gym and make better eating choices. I've tried everything I can think of. Can we put our collective minds together and help a man out.

brokenchalkboard,"Hi all, I'm new here. I'm always on reddit but never thought about looking for a PPD subreddit? Despite being in like 4 other mental health related subreddits? Idk 

So I'll be brief. I'm 22 and my fiance and I knew we both wanted kids, and when our son came into existence, we were pretty over the moon. I have had an extensive history of mental health problems due to trauma, abuse, death, ect. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 11 and then Borderline personality disorder at 19. Which fucking sucks by the way, it's so insanely stigmatized and I'm terrified ever telling anyone I have it because the world views us as monsters. (Yes, I can acknowledge that  people with BPD can cause destruction and harm, though it isn't exclusive to us despite it being prominent. Mostly we don't intend on what we do and are filled with so many raw emotions and pain. I'm not saying this to negate an experience with BPD, but perspective? Idk)

I'm a quieter person with BPD. teen years were hard but as adulthood has come around, I've mellowed out and found great success with doing solo DBT. 

But oh fuck. Once I had my baby, my entire mental health was just.... thrown out the window. 

The biggest thing was paranoia. I didn't want to talk to anyone because I thought they would take my baby from me and that I would be deemed an unfit parent. So I just said I was sad at check ups, but didn't divulge more. I am constantly followed by what feels like dread, guilt, hatred, anger, sadness, regret and intrusive thoughts. The intrusive thoughts were about hurting my baby and it was so fucking scary. He would just yell and yell and it's like there was a battle going on in my head between two people. ""Throw him."" ""He's a fucking baby! I can't throw him!"" ""Se him down and go slit your wrists, then. You're a shitty Mom""

I've relapsed with an unspecified eating disorder too. That makes it so much harder. I dropped 13lbs last month and just can't force myself to eat, because if it isn't ""safe"", then I purge it. It's stupid. 

So the headline. I was at my baby's 4 month appointment and I was already feeling insanely anxious for some reason. They asked me how I was doing and I was honest and told them. I started to cry if they asked me if I had thoughts of hurting him. I told them yes, but they're not something I would ever act on, or welcome, or entertain. I was so scared. I was just sobbing and clutching him, begging them to not take him away. 

They quickly reassured me they wouldn't take him away, just that they're concerned for me. I'm being weaned off of 40mg of prozac and trying paxadil next. I haven't been successful with other depression/anxiety meds. 

I feel so lost and scared. I so badly want to be his Momma, I so badly want him to grow up with fond memories, I so badly don't want to fucking feel this way. I'm only happy when I'm cuddling him, and despite that being a good thing, I want to feel alive in other aspects of my life. 

It's scary, lonely, isolating. I've thought about calling crisis lines many times and going to inpatient. I don't know what to do at this point. Last week I took a turn for the worst and had 5 anxiety attacks after not having them for a couple of years. It just sucks and I guess this is me venting. I just needed to get it out.",Postpartum_Depression,I was honest with my health care provider and it was fucking terrifying,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/f6xsai/i_was_honest_with_my_health_care_provider_and_it/,1582250324.0,2020-02-20 18:58:44,1.699015605173034e+19

HokieGirl07,I had severe ppd the second I came home from hospital after traumatic birth. They tried a couple different SSRIS on me the first month but I was so out of whack the initial “break in” phase made me crazy and me wanting to harm the baby etc. so I got off those quickly. Now 7.5 mos I’m less volatile but definitely down still so they started me on a very low dose of Prozac. They said I will likely have a break in period again before I feel better but to try to stick through it. I’m noticing a week in I’m SUPER tired and having disconnections from my baby. She’s been a little fussy the last two days and it has been making me bonkers and bad thoughts about her going away or wishing she’d never been born resurface.

pubeastank,"I’m 24 f and I had my first child in December. She’s 2 months old now and the first month was relatively easy, but once she hit one month things went downhill very quickly. The more time progresses the less I feel like myself. I have PTSD so I’m not a stranger to serious depression and anxiety. So when I found out I was pregnant unexpectedly the first thought I had was PPD. Well a week ago I was officially diagnosed with it and I just feel like an absolute failure. I had a job for 5 years in a daycare before she was born but my boyfriend and I agreed it would be best for me to be a stay at home mom and take care of her myself. I’ve recently been questioning if that was the right choice. 
My daughter is not an easy baby. She cries for absolutely no reason all the time. When she cries it sets my anxiety off ten fold. It’s like nails on a chalkboard. It gets so bad I have to put her down and just walk outside and use my vape, because of this I worry she will be behind because she HATES tummy time and I mentally cannot stand to listen to her cry. I have to hold her all the time so I feel like I’m holding her back physically because I just can’t set her down without losing my mind. 
My boyfriends shifts are all over the place and some days he works until 11 and comes home tired to both me and the baby crying which just makes me feel 12 times worse because he already works all day and I have to rely on him so much when he comes home and wants to relax. He’s really supportive and he’s never made me feel bad but I just feel terrible about how much he worries about me. He’s also on occasion treated me like I might snap one day and harm the baby and that’s furthest from the truth. Now it’s getting worse because where I used to be able to sleep easily when she’s asleep now I’m laying awake at night thinking about how awful I am and how my baby and her father would be better off if I just didn’t exist in their lives. I know I’m probably going to need to end up on medication so I’m not a risk to myself, but I’m scared of the trial and error that comes with it. I’ve had bad experiences with medications in the past. 
I just feel so absolutely lost and sad. I have no energy to do any of the things it seems all of the moms I know can do, taking care of their houses and themselves. My house is a mess, I barely find the time to take care of myself which doesn’t help the fact that I feel squishy, fat and gross 90% of the time. And Most of the time I feel so disconnected from my daughter and that breaks my heart because I love her and I think she deserves so much better than me. 
The worst part of it all is 2018 I worked so hard on my own and with my therapist to get to a point where I could actually say I loved myself and felt comfortable in my skin, and it’s all out the window now. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I just want to disappear.

Medium_We1l,"This may sound like the dumbest thing on the planet but bear with me.

I believe a lot of my PPD comes from going from being competitively athletic to completely back to square one fitness and endurance wise. I think the lack of exercise and PPD antagonize each other greatly in my case.

Walking doesn’t make me feel better because some days even a few miles with the stroller can level me, dependent on my mood/hydration/if I was able to est that day, and it often makes me cry that I’m not running. 

I can’t currently afford a membership to the gyms in my town.

However.

Someone put a few Richard Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies tapes on YouTube.

I wish I wasn’t genuinely saying this, but I think they saved my life a little bit? 
I am a big fan for YouTube workout videos, but when my PPD is bad, doing even “light no impact HIIT for beginner” workouts breaks my heart and makes me cry about how little I can do at the moment.

But sweating to the oldies is SO SILLY and they’re an hour long and it’s all these cute fluffy hair older ladies just dancing with you and it just lets your brain take a vacation. My infant literally laughs at me from the swing while I do it too, so ... added bonus.

get_release,"So a few days ago I told my husband about how breastfeeding really fucked up my already not-great boobs and how one basically folds in on itself any time I try to put on a normal (not sports) bra, let alone get any cleavage going on. Even though it definitely bothers me a little deep down, we laughed about it light-heartedly. Well tonight I initiated sex, finally feeling myself for once so we started up when all of a sudden he burst out laughing hysterically because he remembered what I said. I got upset, pushed him away while he apologized, and hid under the covers.. everything I've been holding in for months just came pouring out in heavy sobs.

I'm not a crier but it just really fucking hurt. I know it wasn't malicious intent but I've been trying so goddamned hard here not to sink. I'm stuck home with the baby all day, every day, groundhog day. Feel fat, unfulfilled, unproductive, inadequate. My hair, skin and nails look like shit. We really can't afford any extras right now like an unnecessary haircut or little luxuries like manicures as we just moved- getting the house together for function is the biggest priority.. also diapers and especially baby's specialty formula are just plain ridiculous.. (every time I buy formula, I feel a distant, tiny stab in the heart, a reminder that my shitty body failed me and I couldn't feed my own baby. Mostly over that but still stings) 

I wander around in a daze from task to task, wearing spit-up stained raggedy pajamas, reheating the same cup of coffee 15x yet somehow only end up sipping from it when it reaches to that gross, stomach-turning level of lukewarm. I cook (something I used to really enjoy), clean, do laundry, pay bills, make phone calls, pack lunches, help with homework, do dishes, make endless lists.. feed, change, and entertain the baby.. try to get motivated to organize something to eventually finish getting moved and settled.. realize it's 3pm and I haven't eaten yet (btw I barely eat anything, why am I still a fucking whale?!), try to get some kind of protein and slam a V8 and put on an unconvincing happy face for when my daughter gets off the bus. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

I do find joy in little things but it takes a lot of effort most days. I have almost no self confidence or feeling of self worth anymore. I'm disgusted with my post pregnancy body. I can't seem to muster up the discipline or motivation to change it. I feel detached, try to engage with and pay attention to my older daughter however she, like any other meaningful connection feels so far away. I feel stupid for feeling sorry for myself. And this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Now I'm laying here thinking I shouldn't have ever said anything to him because that's all he's ever going to think of when he looks at me and I can't deal with that because I'm inches away from hating myself.

I'm barely running on autopilot anymore. My PPA PPOCD and PPD are tipping the scales. I thought I had it under control though it's obvious I don't. I'm somehow simultaneously a robot and an emotional wreck. My kids deserve better. I'm really ashamed that I can't pull it together in any sense of the phrase.

gentletemple,"Hi, long story ahead. If nobody reads or replies, I'm okay with that. I don't blame you because I hate reading this much text too. I'm just doing this for catharthis and maybe there's somebody out there who has walked in my shoes. So far in my life I haven't met anybody that's gone through this, and most of the support is for the person suffering from OCD and not specifically for the partner.

We had amazing sex that day she found out she was pregnant and I thought the worst was behind us. I was so wrong. That was over 10 months ago and things have rapidly declined since then. I was naïve to think a pregnancy was the answer to our relationship problems.

My wife, who is an experienced psychotherapist, has severe mental health issues (GAD, OCD and now postpartum OCD) that have reached a point where I'm ready to leave the marriage, but we now have a  son and I want to save our family. I'm no saint, I have all my own flaws too but this is insanity and I'm at my wits end with how to fix this. We have been together since high school and I truly love her, but these issues have severely damaged our relationship in the last few years.

Chapter 1: Infertility, GAD and OCD

This all started 5 years ago when we began trying to have our first baby. After years of unexplained infertility, my wife's generalized anxiety disorder and OCD tendencies became exacerbated to the point that it was impacting me and making it really hard to be a compassionate supporting husband. It began to smother me as she began to resent life and she directed all that anger at me. I really hated being around her and I didn't feel safe at home, so I stopped coming home. I went out with friends after work just to have some fun. After a while of this, she fell into a deep depression and she told me she felt abandoned in the hardest time of her life, and wanted to commit suicide. The only thing that kept her going was her obsession with having a baby.

I realized what a selfish asshole I was being and I re-committed myself to her. I started leaving work earlier, getting us into social circles, going to church to encourage her spirit and give her hope, going on fun dates together and traveling around the world, researching all the possible ways to have a family so she felt like we had a plan together. I wanted to start my own business but I had to put that dream aside for hers. My investments and savings for business got used now for an adoption and IVF treatment fund.

There were 2 more years of this infertility (total over 4 years before it ended) In the meanwhile, our relationship continued to go south because of her contamination OCD behaviors, but I kept putting myself aside for her dream to have a baby. She took on 3 jobs just to distract herself with busyness so she wouldn't spiral into depression thinking about infertility. Our sex life no longer became fun, and intimacy pretty much died. I would be her emotional punching bag one minute and then switch to her sperm donor ATM on command. If I ever refused sex because I didn't feel loved, it became a huge fight and I quickly learned that my feelings on the situation didn't matter. I felt like I was being a good husband with my time and resources and not getting anything back in return. I pretty much felt invisible as her husband, and we basically became roommates in pursuit of her goal to have baby.

At this point in the relationship I started to realize how much her OCD and anxiety was affecting my behaviors and my happiness. My behaviors were adapting to hers. I started seeking out attention and validation from outside the marriage. I also began abusing substances like alcohol and weed to mask my feelings, so I sought out therapy for myself and I convinced her to go to an OCD treatment center. She went for a bit then dropped the treatments when they became too scary for her. I stayed in therapy for myself because I needed someone to talk to. My therapist expressed much concern over trying to bring a child into the world in our state of things, but all I could control is myself.

I convinced my wife to see her own talk therapist to cope with the generalized anxiety disorder, and join a couples therapist with me to strengthen our relationship. I had to practically drag her into this one because she was oblivious to our relationship problems due to her fixation on getting pregnant. So that's 3 therapists we were seeing every week now. Things began to look up, at least we were communicating better, and I felt more supportive of her because I had support for myself.

There were glimpses where she remembered who I was to her and I had my old wife back. I remember one specific occasion where I was scheduled to undergo surgery for the infertility, and she got extremely scared I was going to die so she had me cancel the surgery. She confessed her love and care for me and I felt like I had my old wife back. That was short lived, as soon as the fear of me dying was gone, she went back to thinking about infertility and I didn't matter once again.

In our therapy sessions, every single therapist said we had reached a crossroads where the therapeutic goals for our relationship could not be reached until she got serious treatment for OCD. She used the excuse that treatments would stress her out and be too triggering to conceive a baby and so she refused to do it.

Chapter 2: Pregnancy and Postpartum OCD

&amp;#x200B;

It was at this point that my wife became pregnant. She was ecstatic and I was relieved. She dropped out of her own therapy for the reason above, and she didn't see the point of couples therapy now so she stopped going. Looking back on it, I think she only went because she was afraid of me leaving her and she really didn't want any hiatus on the pregnancy attempts.

We had amazing sex that day she found out she was pregnant and I thought the worst was behind us. I was so wrong. That was over 10 months ago and things have rapidly declined since then. I was naive to think a pregnancy was the answer to our relationship problems.

Pregnancy just made her worry worse than before. She quit all her jobs and spent all day worrying. She was calling the triage hotline multiple times a day for the entire term. It's understandable right, after 4 years of infertility, she wanted everything to go right. I get it. But she absolutely cast me aside and didn't seem to care at all because she deemed the baby's health more important than my feelings. She practically hasn't laid a finger on me since that day she got pregnant. No kissing, no touching, hugging, nothing because she is afraid of contamination. What's worse, she expected me to still be a loving and supportive man and can't seem to understand why I didn't feel motivated to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the baby is born, should be a relief right? Nope. During the hospital stay and at the pediatrician's after, the staff expressed much concern for her. They pulled me aside and said they've never seen anyone this bad and I should get her help immediately.

This freaked me out so I brought up the issue again several times after the baby is born. She is just not willing to face it and she gets very upset with me for talking about it. In her defense, I get frustrated and angry that this situation keeps getting worse and she isn't willing to do her part to fix it.

Within the first week of my son's birth we were talking about separating just to have peace in the home for our son. I thought this was insane how we got here so I suggested counseling again.

I was able to get her to come to couples counseling with me again, but only one session. The therapist once again said she needed to work on OCD, and this made her drop out. I dropped too because fuck it I can't make her and I don't have the energy anymore.

At home I am not allowed to touch my son and I'm missing out on bonding with him. My wife is hibernating and won't let anyone come over. Grandparents haven't met their grandson. She says this is because of flu season and that's all it is, but she will not give me a concrete time of when it will be safe and life can go back to normal. I expressed my concern that maybe she is too isolated and she violently resists this and says I need to trust her more.

The house is a complete mess, but she won't let me do laundry or dishes, and I'm confined to a few spaces where its safe for me to hang out. I can't go near the baby's bassinet or in his nursery or his bathroom. She will not let me hire a cleaner or invite her mother over to clean. I am however expected to clean up trash and she generates A LOT of waste. She leaves the faucets and showers running unattended for up to 30 minutes. I get dozens of boxes shipped to me from Amazon every week. We fill up maybe 6-7 full bags of garbage per week and I'm running to the dumpster 2 times a week in addition to trash day. Why all this trash? She buys things off Amazon and then throws them away when they get contaminated. She's buying expensive devices and things to ease her mind about the baby. A lot of times they are never even used, she just gets an anxious feeling and doesn't want it anymore. I think I make good money but I'm killing myself working and I have nothing to show for it now because my savings account keeps draining every paycheck. I feel so disrespected by that and I've tried to communicate it to her but she doesn't change anything.

Her OCD has infiltrated almost every area of the home and marriage to the point where I feel supervised constantly and don't feel safe in my own home. But I can't leave because I am expected to be home supporting her and the baby. She wants me around to pay the bills and be her emotional support system and be present for the baby. Keep in mind I want to help! I want to be involved!

Chapter 3: Where do we go from here?

I fell into a depression in the last few months. The thoughts of sacrificing my dream of owning a business for her dream of having a baby hurts so much because she knew about this dream of mine since we were teenagers. The thought of having to leave a wife I love and a son I love just to feel better. I felt alone and rejected and hopeless. Once again burying myself with drugs, alcohol and porn in attempts to feel better, but it didn't help. One day I was driving to work and I thought about crashing my car just to make the pain stop. I realized how selfish that was and I didn't want my son to lose his dad, so I started seeking help again. I began working out at the gym a lot and I cut out all substances. I signed up with a male therapist who specializes in exactly the kinds of issues I'm dealing with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling a lot better these weeks so I felt ready to have tough conversations again. Things came to a head tonight when she got jealous of me going to the gym for my mental health. I said I was so unhappy that I can't stay in this marriage. I told her I felt like I gained a son and lost a wife. I told her I felt like she was cold, calloused and hates my guts. She said she loves me 99% of the time and would be devastated if I left. It's not her intention to hurt she says. She cares about me still.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that I was emotionally manipulating her and backing her into a corner. She asked me to stop bringing up anything related to finances, her OCD, or my desire to interact with my son. She said every time I bring it up it makes her feel worse and triggers her anxiety and removes her sense of security in the relationship. I get that. But I'm a human with feelings and I deserve to be seen.

&amp;#x200B;

I need her help to break a dysfunctional pattern we have built up over the years. The one where I become frustrated, put up emotional walls and become distant from her. I lose all motivation to want to be a supportive partner in the ways she needs. Then we talk it through and I feel closer to her, and safer expressing myself, so I let her back into my inner world. In my eyes I'm giving her an opportunity to connect with me and help me, and it gets payed back with more feelings of rejection.

Whether it's malicious or not, conscious or not, it doesn't really matter the intention or the intellectual reasons behind it, it still hurts emotionally and damages my attempts to rebuild intimacy. She gives me a sense of connection and belonging with her words, then takes it away with her actions. She says it's the anxiety and she's not choosing it, it's not personal. That doesn't mean much to me because it still hurts. I don't get why it has to be me or the baby, why can't it be me AND the baby?

I lose trust in her and I put the walls back up. And the cycle continues, except the next time it takes extra courage to ask for help and it hurts extra worse when I'm let down again. I don't know how to break this pattern and I really need help. I feel like I've tried to show her the damage its doing to me, but it's not sinking in, and I'm seriously running out of ideas.

She said she will try medication and get therapy when the baby is older. There's no concrete plan there. She asked me to tough it out a few months longer. I'm guessing she means in the summer after flu season is passed, but judging by how history went, this is just another way of me enabling her mental illness and putting my own needs aside. It's clear to me that I'm not a top priority in her life anymore because the anxiety is all consuming, and I just can't see when it will ever end.

The only hope I have left is that everybody says anxiety and OCD are treatable. The question is when will she realize how necessary it is? And will I still be around to see that happen?",Postpartum_Depression,[long venting] the damaging impacts of OCD/PPOCD on a spouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/exmady/long_venting_the_damaging_impacts_of_ocdppocd_on/,1580662488.0,2020-02-02 09:54:48,1.1836832903935937e+19
gentletemple,"Hi, long story ahead. If nobody reads or replies, I'm okay with that. I don't blame you because I hate reading this much text too. I'm just doing this for catharthis and maybe there's somebody out there who has walked in my shoes.  


This is more of a venting than anything, because I am so lonely and don't know what to do besides write out my emotions. I know people will say talk to a professional but just read on because it's complicated.

My wife, who is an experienced psychotherapist, has severe mental health issues (GAD, OCD and now postpartum OCD) that have reached a point where I'm ready to leave the marriage, but we now have a  son and I want to save our family. I'm no saint, I have all my own flaws too but this is insanity and I'm at my wits end with how to fix this. We have been together since high school and I truly love her, but these issues have severely damaged our relationship in the last few years.  


Chapter 1: Infertility, GAD and OCD

This all started 5 years ago when we began trying to have our first baby. After years of unexplained infertility, my wife's generalized anxiety disorder and OCD tendencies became exacerbated to the point that it was impacting me and making it really hard to be a compassionate supporting husband. It began to smother me as she began to resent life and she directed all that anger at me. I really hated being around her and I didn't feel safe at home, so I stopped coming home. I went out with friends after work just to have some fun. After a while of this, she fell into a deep depression and she told me she felt abandoned in the hardest time of her life, and wanted to commit suicide. The only thing that kept her going was her obsession with having a baby.  


I realized what a selfish asshole I was being and I re-committed myself to her. I started leaving work earlier, getting us into social circles, going to church to encourage her spirit and give her hope, going on fun dates together and traveling around the world, researching all the possible ways to have a family so she felt like we had a plan together. I wanted to start my own business but I had to put that dream aside for hers. My investments and savings for business got used now for an adoption and IVF treatment fund.

There were 2 more years of this infertility (total over 4 years before it ended) In the meanwhile, our relationship continued to go south because of her contamination OCD behaviors, but I kept putting myself aside for her dream to have a baby. She took on 3 jobs just to distract herself with busyness so she wouldn't spiral into depression thinking about infertility. Our sex life no longer became fun, and intimacy pretty much died. I would be her emotional punching bag one minute and then switch to her sperm donor ATM on command. If I ever refused sex because I didn't feel loved, it became a huge fight and I quickly learned that my feelings on the situation didn't matter. I felt like I was being a good husband with my time and resources and not getting anything back in return. I pretty much felt invisible as her husband, and we basically became roommates in pursuit of her goal to have baby.   


At this point in the relationship I started to realize how much her OCD and anxiety was affecting my behaviors and my happiness. My behaviors were adapting to hers. I started seeking out attention and validation from outside the marriage. I also began abusing substances like alcohol and weed to mask my feelings, so I sought out therapy for myself and I convinced her to go to an OCD treatment center. She went for a bit then dropped the treatments when they became too scary for her. I stayed in therapy for myself because I needed someone to talk to. My therapist expressed much concern over trying to bring a child into the world in our state of things, but all I could control is myself.

At birth, our son received a diagnosis of Down Syndrome. This was a huge shock to us, and was completely unexpected. Our son is now 8 months old, and the following has been happening since we brought him home.

Current Situation:  
My wife is completely beside herself with guilt about his Down Syndrome. She found out that the mother is typically the cause of the genetic defect, and cannot overcome it. She is boxing me out, and making a martyr of herself in almost any situation. We had a disagreement this evening when he wouldn't fall asleep in her arms due to her anxiety, but she couldn't give him to me to put down because then she felt like a failure as a mother. We had a mostly civil conversation about what had happened, but this is daily for me. My reserves of energy and empathy are drained, and I feel like my wife is taking energies we should sooner spend on our child and his development. Every day feels like a minefield, and the smallest inconvenience can send her nuclear. She is in outpatient for the last few weeks, but I don't know if she is properly utilizing the counseling or is just phoning it in. Both her mother and father are concerned, as well as myself. It is nearly impossible to make it through a single day without her having a full-blown breakdown, even though nothing particularly tragic occurred. I just don't know what to do anymore, and feel like I am at my breaking point. If I take her out of the equation, I can enjoy our son despite his impending surgery, and give him the best life I know how. She is spends most days on the couch watching TV while scrolling Facebook. Procrastination has become a way of life for her, and she lets everything pile up until it is a catastrophe. I don't mind picking up the slack because I understand how she feels, but the daily explosions of anger and frustration and the smallest of issues makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home. Her unhappiness is seeping into me, and I worry how it will affect our son as he gets older if it isn't taken care of by then.

Well last night I finally started to feel a bit better physically, but my mental health rapidly declined. I called my boyfriend crying my eyes out and terrified. I was terrified that I was getting her sick by holding her and that someone would break in on us. I spent an over an hour crying hysterically. 

I’ve been having terrible nightmares and they have caused me to be really paranoid around the house. Nightmares of my baby being taken away and kidnapped. I don’t know why these dreams keep reoccurring... maybe some PTSD of abuse I experienced earlier in my life. Anyway, I have a hard time leaving her in her bassinet by herself, or going to sleep not knowing if she’s going to be there in the morning whenever I wake up. 

I’ve posted on this sub before, but I feel like every time I go back to the doctor, things just gradually keep declining. I thought I was finally starting to feel better, but now it’s turned into major anxiety. I’ve thought about admitting myself to the hospital multiple times because I’m not okay. I have to be honest with myself and everyone else that I’m not okay. It would tear up my family if I was admitted. I don’t want to do that to them, but I feel like I need to look out for my mental health and it is not okay. My boyfriend came home last night and comforted me. We watched a show on tv and he told me that we would talk about things later. Before going to bed, he asked how I would feel about getting admitted. I didn’t know what to think. He’s never been the one to suggest it, I have. He told me that he thought it would be the best thing for myself, him, and our daughter for me to seek more help. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to miss that much class. It sucks to not be able to take care of my own freaking mental health because I’m scared of missing school and not being able to attend lecture, or failing due to absences. I already have 3 absences in one of my classes. I nervous about leaving my baby behind. I’m nervous that if I do admit myself voluntarily then I will be shipped off to an inpatient treatment facility for a while because my mental health is that bad. I don’t want to leave my baby, but I’m shaking right now and I don’t know if it’s  because of a medication side effect, paranoia, or due to my infection. I just needed to get this out there.

NekoKitty919119,"Idk why I can't get adjusted to my baby screaming or crying. She is 16 months old and I feel nothing but resentment towards her. I hate how clingy she is and how she cries for everything. She recently got into pinching, fighting, screaming, biting, hair pulling and it upsets me because I don't hit her. When I feel low i hand her to her dad and take a breather but lately that hasn't been enough anymore. I'm tired of the same routine every day. I'm tired of sleepless nights and not being able to function except out of fear, anger, resentment. It's gotten to the point where I want her and her father to get their things and leave. I'm so angry with him because he is lazy. Everyone in the hospital told him to not let her get used to the bed, and to jot carry her unless she was crying. Due to me having a c section, didn't care that I was in grad school finishing my masters and I needed her to be as independent as possible. Nooope. He sabotaged that, I get it we are in love with her but he did spoil her and get her used to the bed and to being held all the time to the point I have to go to the bathroom sitting with her on my lap. I can't even wash dishes without her having a melt down. I can't stand her temperament either. She has melt downs everyday over things that had she not been spoiled wouldn't occur. She has a meltdown over me not looking at her all the time. I turn away to wash a dish or put away laundry, and she cries as if someone is beating her. I worry that I'll get the cops called on me when I'm trying to take a shit alone. It doesn't help that my parents think my PPD is fake and only occurs when she acts horrendous.

Opalrose25,"
Tldr: My symptoms escalated and I ended up being admitted to a psychiatric hospital. It saved my life.


I was hit with antepartum depression halfway through my second trimester. Antidepressants helped once I found the right dosage. Counseling saved me when I became suicidal in my third trimester. I thought everything would level out once I had her. I. Was. Wrong.


My symptoms gradually worsened as I tried to wean off my antidepressants. I ended up having a major crash from sleep deprivation and my dosage change. I don't remember much from that night other than being crouched down in the hallway crying outside my baby's nursery. My husband tells me I also tried to leave the house in the middle of the night.


My meds were adjusted again and I was feeling better until I got back to work. I quickly started deteriorating and going downhill faster than I could fathom. You name the symptom, I had it. Self hate, agression towards my husband,  feeling distant from my baby, weight gain, anxiety and panic attacks, OCD, PTSD from my c section (I felt WAY MORE than I should have) suicidal ideations, memory loss, my jaw permanently clenched... I could go on and on.

Everything came to a headway on Sunday. I left the baby with my husband and essentially ran away from home. I found myself at a park down the road from my house and I wailed. I had never wanted to die more in that moment than any time before. I couldn't take the emotional and physical pain anymore. I was done.

My husband in a panic called my therapist who called me and advised I go to the ER. I was adamant that I didn't need hospitalization, but she knew better. After much deliberation, I finally caved. Hospitalization was my last stitch effort to survive this terrible disease. With one foot in front of the other, I walked into an ER and uttered the words ""postpartum depression with suicidal ideations.""

I am so amazed and thankful for the hospital staff. They attended me with compassion and understanding. I was tranferred to a psychiatric hospital where I spent four days in an ""intensive care"" unit. Four long days of intensive therapy, a slight medication change, classes on coping, and community building with others like me. By day three, I truly felt whole again. I remembered who I was before all this mess. I was discharged yesterday and was able to return home to my wonderful husband and beautiful baby. 

I'm not going to lie, it was a hard journey. Im still on it, but I want  you to  know there is light at the end of this dark shitty tunnel. I want to let you know it's okay to admit you need more help. I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are loved. You are worthy of all good things and deserve peace.

I hope you find your peace. Know that although hospitalization is scary, it's worth fidning yourself and coming out a better partner and mommy. 

One of the most important things I learned during my stay is that we don't have to be perfect, just good enough. Perfection ends up making our little gremilns neurotic and at higher chance of developing their own mental illnesses. My doctor says that a C+ parent is ideal. 

Please don't wait until you are too far gone to seek help. Please know that hospitalization is an option and know that it's better for you to go in voluntarily than involuntarily. It's definitely better than being dead.

I'm sending you love and light. Keep fighting. We are more than this bullshit illness. We will make it to the other side.",Postpartum_Depression,I Was Admitted,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/eqbawr/i_was_admitted/,1579343913.0,2020-01-18 03:38:33,3.10827822346108e+18
Thisuckz,"I'm feeling so unattractive, ugly, fat, gross..... I tried buying new underwear... too find out I'm too fat to wear a large anymore. Lady at Walmart tried to make me feel better by saying ""they run small"". Let's face it. I'm a cow anymore. I just want to feel pretty and sexy again. 
I made this stupid account thinking it'll help me. But I feel stupid for ranting, but in all honestly I'm too poor for a psychiatrist, and I feel bad for burdening my family and husband with my feelings. So here I am telling the whole stupid world how I feel.
My husband says I'm just as beautiful and sexy as our wedding day. But let's face it, I was ""chubby"" back then. Now I'm a fat cow with gross stretch marks all over my belly. 
Some have mentioned I should have a day at the spa, spoil myself with new ""sexy clothes"" as they put it, get my nails done, a new hair style ect. But I'm too poor for all of that, and what's the use of something new to wear when we haven't gone on an actual date since the day we got engaged in 2018.
We use to cuddle all the time, but my husband doesn't like too anymore, he says he's just too tired once we get the baby asleep, but I can't help feeling its because he doesn't want to cuddle a cow. Who could blame him. He use to put his hands in my back pockets while I did dishes or cooked, and pull my shirt up just enough to put his hands on my bare belly and hold me like that for what seemed like forever. But not anymore. 
I eat when I'm extremely depressed like now, but then I see all these skinny beautiful girls at work, some with babies the same age as my little one, and then I get so depressed I stop eating thinking I'd get skinny that way. But then this fat cow see's chocolate, cookies, salsa, anything yummy, and I indulge. My poor husband probably thinks I'm a pig too since I'm always eating.

consciousmonkeys,"Our daughter is 18 months old now. My partner has been changing since the pregnancy but ever since the problematic birth I feel hopeless as a partner.

harvestmoonwitch,"I have OCD. I’ve been on Prozac since I was 19. They raised my dose from 40mg to 60mg while pregnant because of the extra fluids and blood flow, but I haven’t really noticed a change. I was anxious my whole pregnancy that something would go wrong and would literally daydream about being postpartum and having the baby here so I could see him and know he was okay. 

Obviously I was naive, because he’s here now and all I do all day is worry about if he’s okay. He’ll cuddle up with me or his dad and then feel warm afterward, and I’ll obsessively check his temperature. I google everything. Every grunt, sneeze, cry, or odd facial twitch terrifies me and sets off a 911 alarm in my brain. He literally just had his first pediatrician appointment and they said he’s strong and good. He eats a ton, which worries me, but the pediatrician said some babies just have bigger appetites than others and he was already back at birth weight and makes plenty of wet and messy diapers, so he’s doing fine. But for some reason I still panic about everything and worry constantly about him getting sick. 

My parents were in town, but just left this morning and my husband goes back to work first thing tomorrow. My sister lives with us, so I have someone here, but she’s younger than me and having my parents here made me feel safe because they feel more “adult” than I do and know what to worry about and what not to. My husband is also incredibly level headed and can keep me feeling calm and safe. His mom is coming over to help while he’s at work, but I’m not super comfortable with my in-laws and their parenting skills and almost feel more stress at the idea of her helping me. 

Also, my labor was long and I narrowly avoided an emergency c-section due to high heart rate and fevers from a Chorio infection, so the birth didn’t go as I’d imagined or hoped and was quite stressful for me, resulting in a 2nd degree tear. So I’ve also been obsessive over my health as well and have been crying a lot and panicking, which makes me feel dizzy or nauseated or hot and that only makes me obsess more and worry that I could drop dead at any moment. I worry they overlooked something and my infection isn’t cured or whatever and they released me too soon, etc. Just not rational, but these thoughts still rush through my head and make me start sobbing, especially without my parents here to reassure me and knowing my husband has to be gone for a big chunk of every day. 

I have a therapy appointment on Thursday and am hoping that helps. I’m also hoping that now that I am PP that my meds start working more effectively. But I’m not sure if that’s how it works? I am taking steps to make sure I get treatment for this, but it feels difficult in the meantime. All this worry and panic feels heavy. 

I’ve been trying to meditate, which has helped slightly. And I know there are a lot of hormones running through my body. But I feel exhausted no matter how much sleep I get (which, I’ll admit, is minimal even when I have someone watch the baby for me) because I have so many thoughts rushing through my head all day. 

So my OCD has gotten worse for sure. It feels like where it was when I was a teenager. I don’t know exactly why I’m posting this. Maybe to feel less alone?

kittyhaven,"Aloha! On my island, there are no resources for new moms. I have a psychiatrist, but therapists are in such short supply that I can’t get in to see one more often than once a month. There are no mom groups. When you’re having scary thoughts, they just tell you to go to the ER and maybe you can get approved to fly to Honolulu for outpatient treatment (leads to a 12 hour day away from home). So I’m at the point in my PPD where I’m doing better and I’m pissed at this. So I’m gonna start my own mom’s group with a focus on mental health, but open to any mother that wants to socialize.

So I’m looking for recommendations and resources to help me with guiding a structured aspect of the group with a focus on providing moms with resources and some sanity. Any book recommendations? Any workbooks? Anyone been to an outpatient program and what tools/ coping skills did you learn?

siirius03,"Hi y’all. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been battling PPD/PPR(rage) for many months now after a year from hell. 

In a nutshell, hubby left 3 days PP (second baby was born a year ago) because he had to go on a military tasking in our home province, about 2 hours away from our hometown and where both of our parents live. I flew to our hometown 3 weeks later with both kids, and stayed with my dad and his gf. His gf made my life a living hell there, I tried to be out of the house as much as possible and spent days/nights visiting other family and my hubby. After about 3 months I couldn’t take it anymore and moved in with my in-laws who I don’t exactly get along with. That only lasted 3 days before my MIL flipped out and I left, then I moved in with my sister into a tiny little room on an air mattress with my 2 kids. Where we stayed for the remaining 2 months. 

After being there for 5 months total, hubby and I  drove back home. Get home to discover we lost our entire friend group, I lost my job due to budget cuts, just so many things continued to go wrong. He’s now overseas and is wanting a separation. 

I am no longer the mother that I once was. I was a wonderful mother to my first born. Calm, patient, loving. Now I’m miserable, quick to snap, most days I don’t even want my kids around me. The baby is needy, whiny, my eldest is being a typical 3 yo. I have no friends and no family to help. I have no alone time which I so desperately need. Hiring a sitter isn’t even an option due to finances. I’m being touched and needed all day everyday and it’s becoming way too much for me. I’m not on medication because the previous times I’ve tried them, I hated them, they didn’t make me feel good at all. I’ve been taking vitamins and I’ve started iron transfusions as per doctor’s recommendation but I don’t think it’s working. 

My kids are just being kids but I honestly just can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to be touched or snuggled and I don’t want to have these conversations that go in circles with my 3 yo. Mommy I want this, mommy I want that. Just leave me alone!! And then the baby is just always screaming and crying in my face. I don’t know what to do, but I need help.

thunderbirdandspice,"Hello all! I’m about 4 months PP and I’m struggling with nightmares every night. Every night I wake up constantly from different dreams of my baby being hurt, taken, killed. They’re so realistic and severe that when I wake up I’m always pouring sweat and I’m confused about where I am. I’ve gotten sick to my stomach a few times, woken up crying a few times. I was just wondering if this sounded like a PPD symptom or if nightmares at this stage are maybe normal? I don’t know. My OB dropped me as a patient because I had to switch to Medicare after my birth when I wasn’t able to return to work, and my old psychiatrist doesn’t accept Medicare either so I just wasn’t sure who to ask.

anon54672,"My baby will be 3 months in a couple of days and our journey has been wonderful. She is such a good baby only thing is she always wants to be carried which I don’t mind but I can’t get anything done.. 
that being said I love being her mommy but when it comes to me I’ve been an emotional wreck. I often stop myself from crying out of no where because I feel like I have no reason to cry but I just feel sad. When she falls asleep all I want to do is lay down and watch tv or be on my phone even though I know i should clean up the house or do something for myself.. 
I sometimes catch my self in a blur and have to snap myself back to reality especially when I’m breast feeding her. I just look out in the distance with a blank face and thinking of absolutely nothing and if I don’t snap back I start to miss who I use to be and what I use to look like.. 
my whole life I’ve always have body image issues. I was never truly happy with myself. When I found out i was pregnant I got super depressed because I was finally in a place in my life where I loved how i look and all I kept thinking when i saw the test positive was all that hard work for nothing. Everybody was saying that I would bounce back but I see myself now and it makes me so sad that I’m back to square one..

Unhappy-Brilliant,"Everyday I drown in regret. And everyday I drown in guilt because when I look into her innocent eyes, I still wish I never had her. While most parents feel that their lives are completed or their child is the best thing to happen to them, I always feel the opposite. I sit and stare off into space and obsess and imagine what my life would be like if I’d never made this horrible mistake.  I’d imagine how life would be if she’d just cease. The ties that she creates with everyone would no longer exist and the burdens will have left with her as well. She looks at me, she coos and smiles, I’m all that she knows. Every beautiful baby sound is a reminder of a mistake I can’t reverse. She sits and plays, so unaware that the only one she loves and knows is staring back at her with regrets. I sometimes feel like one us just needs to go. 

Everyday is a battle trying to shake these feelings. Nothing but mixed emotions run through my mind nonstop. And no one is helpful, not even my fiancé, her father.

HereComesMama,"My 2nd baby girl was born via c section September 17 2019. I had a c section because I was too afraid to attempt VBAC (I know it was ultimately my decision but when you're hearing from almost everyone around you that I should just do a repeat c-section, it was kind of tough). My first was an emergent c-section. I had a miscarriage between my two daughters. My first daughter was difficult to breast feed because she was very small and ate almost every hour. But, I was able to just lay in bed with her constantly and establish my supply, luckily. Then she had HORRIBLE reflux and was actually pooping blood. Needless to say, I stopped breast feeding at about 3 or 4 months because it wasn't an amazing experience. Ok, back to baby number 2. The second c-section wasn't easier, it was worse in fact. Lots of students in the room including the one cutting me (and the anesthesiologist, YIKES! I didn't know until she poked my back more than once and later was talking with a peer about ""being new""). I was vomiting in the OR and for about 1 day after...horrible dizziness and nausea. My milk came in hard once we got home (as did with my first) and I started over producing which was ok BUT my daughter wasn't latching right. I kept pumping and saw lactation consultants over the next week or two. She was diagnosed with a mild tongue tie which I opted to have treated because maybe that was affecting her latch. Nipple shields weren't helping either. The tie treatment didn't help her latch. Then I developed thrush. I then developed an infection in my c section sight which popped open the incision about 3 cm. I had to pack the wound myself over the next 2 weeks, and it's STILL not healed after almost 3 months post partum. My baby figured out her latch but couldn't drain my breast effectively so always came off screaming for food (even after an hour between both breasts). I tried to keep pumping but my supply started dropping and I couldn't pump as frequently as needed because I have a mobile (and mischievous) 2 year old. I decided a couple days ago to put away my pump and nursing clothes. Formula it is. Everyone is supportive but I can't help but have these intrusive thoughts that they're secretly judging me for not trying harder. I feel guilty. I feel like a quitter. I feel like a wimp. I know, logically, none of these things are true but... I can't help but feel this way. I'm exhausted (duh, waking up every 2 hours will do that to you, even with my husband's help I'm exhausted). I see women who are thin\\fit with a 6 week old. I see them smiling, looking put together and breast feeding with ease. They had an easy vaginal delivery, quick recovery time, baby latched with no problem and EBF because ""breast is best"" (I know it is, and I know fed is best, but I hate that line... it seems like a consolation prize). A friend says ""there's no trophies in motherhood"" and I know it. I know I'll rock the toddler stage because I'm doing it now with my 1st daughter. But damn... I'm just bummed in general.

 I wanted a career we now have 5 kids (2 step children). So I kinda have to give up my dreams I guess that bothers me. I really wanted to start working out, but it's hard to get out of bed. I have this overwhelming feeling to just cry . I just wanna feel anything but this.


I've been breastfeeding and supplementing, but I find myself doing more and more formula which I feel guilty about. So I dont know which will make me feel worse breastfeeding or stopping. Breastfeeding makes me feel completely tied down. I feel this pressure to breastfeed tho.

\*\*\*If anyone has any advice when you finally begin to feel normal...or if anything I mention sounds like what you have gone through please share\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like no one talks about postpartum. You see all these individuals who bounce back, they have the beautiful bodies, sweet babies, and look like a million bucks. Honestly I thought contractions would cause me to scream my lungs out like they do in the movies and so I didn't pay any mind to my labor pains. They didn't feel like what I saw or how some people described it, so I figured nothing to really pay any mind. Ended up going to the hospital to get checked out, instead got rolled in for an emergency cesarian section. I was looking really forward to a natural delivery. What can I do right? Was grateful for a healthy child, and was checking things off my to do list. Need to start walking 24 hours after cesarian, I need to have a bowel movement, need to make sure I am walking, staying hydrated, talk to lactation consultant to ensure child is latching properly. Then the bloody women from birth certificate department comes in and asks me to fill out the bloody paperwork for DD birth certificate. Hubby is away traveling, and I am just staring at this women. I started to almost have a hysterical breakdown because I couldn't even remember how to spell my own name or even my husbands and I forgot how to spell DD name. Like what the actual FUCK is wrong with me. I couldn't even recall how to spell any name, and filling out that paper was like asking me to argue my dissertation that instance. Thank god for my lovely nurse who saw the look on my face and said I'll tell her to take an L and ask you tomorrow. Bless that nurses dearest heart. But honestly those fucking birth certificate lady needs to fucking as anyone but the mother to fill that fucking form out. Like I am still high on drugs. I am not about to make a mistake on those forms. The chick gave me a panic attack. By the time it was my DD feeding time, I forgot that I forgot how to spell any of our names. 

So I finally get rolled out of the hospital and come home. Feel great the first two weeks. Hitting all the expected milestones that the doctor wanted me to do. Then all of a sudden Week 4 pp I am in such severe pain I dropped DD twice. Took my azz to the hospital and was admitted for a week. So depressed to be away from DD, and more so than anything. Bless the GOOD LORD that I didn't curse up a storm when this fucking dickwad comes in on day two to tell me we found nothing on the CT scans, or blood work and I don't think you have any actual pain and it is all in your head or the medical term for that is Somatophorm Disorder. That means I have depression causing fucking pain which is causing me to fucking drop my DD and fall in my fucking ass so hard that I hurt myself. Mind you I wouldn't have been so pissed if he told me this after doing all the necessary tests that were deemed by all my various specialists. Thank GOD that he still had to follow hospital protocol and did my complete MRI where they found the ISSUE. The look on his face was equivalent to me smashing my DD poopy diaper on his face. He comes in post MRI and just makes it seem like nothing. I swear if I could smash my foot up his ass I would have felt so much better. Like I swear the moment I found out what was wrong from the neurologist I was so grateful. I was pissed that dumbass couldn't be clear when he told me my MRI results. Like NO MY PAIN IS NOT IMAGINARY. 

So finally after week in the hospital FINALLY I had an answer as to what is wrong with me and I am being discharged with instructions to follow up care and on treatment schedule. So finally was home getting some rest, now this is where things start going downwards for me. These past three weeks has been pure test of mental and emotional stamina. I have had to use herculan strength not to snap, yell, constantly irritated and angry. Small noises irritate me, people talking to me makes me angry. Conversations feel like I have to do organic chemistry labs. Talking to people feels like so much work, this past week I've just been so tired me and DD have literally slept for 20 out of the 24 hours. And FINALLY today I just snapped.

I have done such a wonderful job of keeping up a wonderful front. Cooked a huge meal for my family, we had dinner and while I was making dinner I pulled on a stitch that was throbbing. My head was dizzy and feel like I have a head cold, so foggy. I have been working all day to keep my temper in check. I have NO HONEST TO GOD REASON to be irritated or anger. I'm getting angry with my own behavior because it makes no dang sense. I was slowly walking down the stairs when I saw the basement door left open and I snapped. I fucking just snapped, and walked to my room and just cried non stop. I was in so much pain, I was in so much fog in my head. I just felt like there is no way I am going to be able to get better. Like the saying fake it til you make it. I couldn't fake it anymore. My sister, brother, mother come in and calm me down. But I seriously can't take it anymore. I understand intelliectually that I had a serious surgery. I understand that I do, but my head is not accepting the fact that I am at least not normal. Meaning why can't I walk faster than fucking toddler. Why am I moving slower than my newborn. If someone asks me a question I have to ask them to repeat themselves so much that I've seen them get irritated because it feels to them that I am not listening. Its like the expressway from my ear to my brain is as jam as LA traffic during rush hour. My head is soo fucking dizzy for no reason. I've checked my blood pressure and sugar and they can not explain my dizziness. My sister tells me my PT is going to make me feel worse before I get better. Why the fuck does no one tell you about the hell that is postpartum. 

I do not recognize myself in the mirror. My husband tells me I look amazing and I only took a fucking shower. Am I this horrendous on a day to day that a shower makes me look so different. I have ZERO appetite. Like I never eat I would be fine. I sleep so much it is not funny. I have not gotten a damn thing done. I need to go to Secretary of State to renew my license, I forgot so much to the point that it is expired. I have to go and get my diploma and I can't get the strength to even do that. I literally forget! The only think I am able to do competently is dress my DD, feed her, burb her, bathe her, play with her, sleep with her...and repeat. Showering myself is a challenge, putting on socks is a challenge, bending feels like applying to PhD schools. Like I thought I was pretty fit, my abdomen feels like the barren dessert, there is NOTHING. I swear I look like a log, The only curves I have are that dip from my chin to my neck. I have no waist, my muscle feels like a water bed, my hair is shedding, my skin can't even give me a break. Clothes feel like sandpaper on my skin. I am comfortable in tanks, light cotton. Like how the fuck am I suppose to dress like a mature adult and go to work while not trying to cry in the bathroom every other minute.

What the fuck is wrong with me. I just feel so much like a mess today. How does one get over this, where is the light at the end of this fucking black hole. I am sooooo fucking tired of my doctor repeatedly telling me I had major surgery and to give time. I have been an energizer bunny all my life this feels like punishment. I want to be able to be there for my DD, I want to be able to function as an adult. Like what is wrong with me? When will this get better?? \*sobbing\*",Postpartum_Depression,What is WRONG with MEEE?!?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/du4xsa/what_is_wrong_with_meee/,1573374258.0,2019-11-10 01:24:18,3.524233069695745e+17
Maltese_the_Cat,"I had a difficult pregnancy followed by an even more difficult time after the birth of my son. I struggle with miscarriages and my husband and I were extremely excited when I made it out of the first trimester. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes fairly early and was put on bed rest after a car accident. I had weekly ultrasounds to track my son's progress and was told that he was perfectly healthy.

He was not immediately given to me when he was born. When he was five minutes old I was told he was missing both thumbs. When he was a day old, he was transfered to the NICU because he was asperating. At four days old, he was transfered to a much larger children's hospital an hour away.  Then at eight days he had surgery to fix an esophageal fistula.

While my son was on a ventilator, I was hospitalized with mastitis and what they believed was an abscess. They did not drain it and after three days I was released. It was the longest three days of my life. I just wanted to be with my son. Less than a week later the fever came back and this time my hospital visit was much longer. It also turns out that my abscess is not an abscess but a tumor that was infected by the mastitis.

I was released from the hospital the day before my son came home. We've been home for a week and a half and I'm struggling. 

My son still can't eat properly, he's had a feeding tube and is connected to a pulse oximeter.  Between doctors visits and his feeding schedule, I haven't healed from the mastitis. I'm waiting for my milk to dry up so that I can have surgery to remove the mass in my breast and I haven't even began to process that I might have breast cancer.

I'm depressed. I'm sick of people asking how I'm doing and saying that I'm strong for what I am going through. The truth is that I'm crying when ever I'm alone and I don't know how to ask for help. My husband is busy working but helps where he can. He actually makes sure I get a solid six hours of sleep in the evenings and makes me breakfast. Honestly, he's been amazing. But I'm still struggling to sleep and finding time to eat. I love my son more than anything but there are times when I just feel numb to the situation, to my husband, and to him.

I don't know what to do. I had a plan on how to handle postpartum depression but I don't have the time to go to a support group or therapist because of my son's feeding schedule or both of our doctor appointments.

skinnyfat3000,"Hi there, I've been diagnosed with ppd yesterday by my gp and I'm currently looking for a therapist. Today is the first day I'm all alone with my 4.5 week old and I'm wondering if you have some tips on how often to socially interact with the baby and how long. I know I'm supposed to talk to and play with the baby.

How often and how long a day is enough so baby will develop normally? If my SO interacts with the baby in the evenings, is that enough? If I talk 5 minutes during ach diaper change and touch all of baby's limbs each time, would that be enough? Is it necessary to talk in baby speech and smile or is a normal face sufficient?

I know these are weird questions but one of my symptoms is that I don't have a natural desire to interact socially with my baby (of course I feed, diaper, burp and carry baby around until baby stops crying) and I don't want baby to be developmentaly delayed because I don't do it often enough.

Are there any cues that I can watch out for that baby wants to interact socially? So far I have now and then tried to show some toys or make weird faces (suggestion by a development app), but each time baby started crying. Baby is currently lying in the crib, flailing arms and making ""eh"" sounds, sometimes looking in my direction. Would this be a good time to interact, and what type of interaction should I do?

My daughter is a rainbow after a miscarriage i never felt anything but joy and gratitude with her, she was such a good baby, she's my sunshine.

I go back to work in 2 weeks. He doesn't take a bottle well, you have to fight with him for him to take it. (He has 5 brands we have tried found his preferred but he still cries). I feel like breastfeeding him makes me stuck to him. I feel guilty that i don't want him to be stuck to me. I feel like hes taking time away from my daughter. 

He drains me so much. He wakes up so much and since he only breastfeeds my husband cant even help. I'm scared to go back to work. I work in a goddam children's hospital. It made me sad even before i was pregnant so I'm scared on wtf I'm going to do with all this crying. 

3 weeks ago i went to a very dark place. I felt like i was in a dark hole, couldn't see the light at the top anymore but i was just sitting in the whole not trying to get out. I didn't want to move or be alive. Unfortunately i couldnt stop my tears. My 4 year old said 
""Whats wrong mom why are you crying"" 
I told her"" im sad baby "" as im holding the baby feeding him

I’ve has depression and anxiety even before I was pregnant, that is why I had planned never to have kids and I wouldn’t be a good mum. But then I got pregnant, completely unwanted and was close to having an abortion, but here in Japan, abortions are frowned upon. Well I made the biggest mistake of my life and kept the baby in fear of judgement. Here I am 10 months later, contemplating suicide after 2 sleepless night whilst he cries uncontrollably due to gas.

So the only way out is to kill myself, I know my baby would be better off without a depressed mother, I’m sure it will be sad for a while but they’ll get over it. My husband will find someone better.

zarzar1986,"When i was 12 wks pregnant i woke up in a pool of blood. Heartbeat and baby didn't show on the ultrasound and they were about to send me for d&amp;c. I begged them to look again and after some minutes of nothing, my daughter appeared along with her heartbeat. I was put on bed rest indefinitely. I then started suffering from depression as could hardly work, couldn't go out and was terrified to even cough or sit up, thinking i could lose her at any moment. I suffered panic attacks and became suicidal but docs refused to give me antidepressants. At 6.5 months i collapsed with arrhythmia and high blood pressure and they couldnt stabilize me, they wanted to do a csection and were moments away from taking me to theater when i stabilized. I was put on bed rest again and became even more depressed and anxious, developed insomnia, and was in great pain. Meanwhile we passed through a tough time due to my work as an investigative journalist- lets just say i was attacked by the gov and hounded publicly. I became more anxious and stressed. I went to the doctor begging for help and she and the midwife laughed in my face repeatedly and told me to ""calm down and think of the baby"". I ended up having an emergency csection at 37 weeks, i was so anxious they told me i would have general anaesthetic but when i got to the operating theatre on the table, they changed their mind and said i would be awake throughout. I was terrified and hysterical. Hours after birth my MIL physically assaulted me and tried to take my daughter out of my arms. She sneaked into the ward twice on the days i was there recovering and proceeded to criticize, harass me and cause me huge anxiety. At home, her harassment continued until i got so stressed from her and the trauma of my ordeal that my milk dried up. I had to return to work (from home) 4 days post partum, with the help of a nanny at home. My SO has stood up for me agains MIL but i dont think he understands what I'm going through and how the last year has scarred me. I work 60 hours 7 days a week, take care of baby, and 5 year old step son, and the house and i feel he doesnt appreciate me.

DernhelmOfGryffindor,"
I’m 11 weeks post partum and I have been feeling depressed for the past 6 weeks. My doctor was concerned because of my post partum questionnaire and offered medicine but I’m not convinced that medicine will help. I had a very difficult labor and recovery, and my body still doesn’t have the stamina it did before childbirth. I had to go back to work at 7 weeks post partum to a very active job, which has been really hard. It was a stressful unpaid leave that I had to fight for to even get that much time off. I was still asked to do some work from home during that time and had lots of emails with HR about various logistics that I had to suddenly take care of. Honestly it was a bit of a nightmare.

My job is very stressful and I feel like I’m not doing the best that I could be. It feels that I’m constantly behind and bringing stuff home, even when I spend 9-10 hours a day there. I hate being away from my baby. I just want to be with her. My husband is awesome and keeps asking what else he can do to take the stress off me, but it doesn’t feel like there is anything he can do. We also are raising three older kids as our own and they have transitioned beautifully to having a baby in the house. I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better transition. 

I realize that I have a great life and that I have so much to be thankful for, but I’m miserable and crying all the time. I feel like I hate my life and just want to run away, but then feel so guilty for feeling that way. I’ve always been pretty driven and motivated, so I never thought I’d want to stay home, but I guess I do now and it’s hard to accept that it’s not financially an option. With the older children, I was grateful to work because it was a distraction from all the court dates and uncertainty of whether they could stay with us. But now that everything is settled, I feel like I’m failing as a mom by working full time. I get insanely jealous when I see others working from home or even staying home with their kids. I hate leaving my baby, but I want to be able to provide a good life to all my kids. I feel so much pressure that I want to scream. I go back and forth between sobbing and feeling numb. It all feels like too much and that I can’t do it. Even my go-to things that help me when I’m going through an emotionally hard time or grieving have lost their appeal. My husband wants me to talk with my doctor more about medicine, but I don’t see how it can help anything as all the pressure I’m feeling will still be there. 

Has anyone else gone through this? If so, was there anything that helped you get through it?

I feel like this is going to make some people mad (and rightfully so) but I just need other moms to talk to. Just somebody.

I’m in my (very) early twenties, in my second long-term relationship. I got pregnant a few months after meeting the father. Due to him being very religious, and myself being bipolar and impulsive, we kept the pregnancy. Towards the end, I began looking into adoption (on my own) because I wanted my child to have the best life possible and I didn’t think I could give that to them. 

My baby was born with special needs. I don’t really want to go into exactly what for personal reasons, but they will more than likely never be independent and in his first month of life I already have to follow up with 5+ specialists. 

I can’t go back to work due to the care my child needs. His father makes around 25k a year, so we’re living off of every government benefit we can and my son’s disability check. He’s now 1 month old.

We’re looking at the reality of losing our apartment when our savings run out in a few months and will have to move across the country to live with his parents, where there is a significant language and cultural barrier. I will be completely alone.

I brought up adoption with my partner after the birth of our son. He has been supportive, and then changed his mind, which I completely understand. We got as far as selecting an amazing family who was willing (and happy) to take on our son. 

I cry every night, although I don’t feel depressed. I just truly feel like my life is over. I do not want to be a mother, which feels disgusting to say. My son needs someone who is 1000% in this, not an unstable disaster. It’s not even his disabilities. I think I would feel this way with a “typical” child. I did feel this way before I knew about his diagnoses. My partner has told me that I can leave, but I want my child to be in a BETTER situation, not worse. My parents asked me if I would have aborted had I known his condition and I told them no, and I stand by that. 

I’ve read articles, books, forums - talked to other moms with kids like my son, and I just feel more and more sick to my stomach about the future.

I don’t know if there is anyone out there who has been in a situation like this. I know it’s stupid to ask for no judgement, but please understand that I love my son and I’m worried about being a negative in his life rather than a positive.

I feel like it’s not entirely PPD, due to the responsibilities of being a parent to a child with special needs, along with being emotionally and financially unable to care for them without help.",Postpartum_Depression,I need help,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/d6qd56/i_need_help/,1568982884.0,2019-09-20 05:34:44,1.3065320310445781e+17
Kalldaro,"I feel like I will never not feel guilty about having PPD with my second. He was wanted and I was excited about giving my older son a brother. But about a month before his due date there was a traumatic incident in the family, I went into labor three weeks early and suffered severe PPD in the coming months. He had developmental delays, which are common in my family, there have been many late bloomers. But I still feel responsible for them. We've also been dealing with hearing issues. He had to get tubez in his ears and they may have to be redone. But as a result he's speech delayed although can communicate well non verbally.

I had trouble bonding with him the first year and I know how important that is.

He's very sweet, loves to cuddle and was quick to learn his numbers, colors, shapes and alphabet. But I still feel like I failed him.

ppdmb,"\*\* This was only supposed to be a couple of paragraphs but I went overboard. Sorry.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Before I begin, some background. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety about 5 years ago, and OCPD a year and a half ago. I was on Zoloft and Xanax for a year but I had to stop cold turkey when I got pregnant because it compounded the morning sickness and I couldn't even drink water without throwing up - I lost 30 lbs in a month from the constant vomiting. 

My pregnancy started out really rough. I had just started a really intense architecture program in school and I had no time for anything. I would literally stay in school for days at a time working on project after project, barely sleeping and only consuming caffeine and whatever snacks the vending machine had to offer. There were a few times that I would go home after 30 hour stretches at my desk, take a nap for an hour, shower, and go right back to school. I was running on fumes. I don't blame my SO for feeling abandoned by me during this time, but the strain was too much and we began fighting constantly. He resented me for spending so much time at school that the few times I did have to rest, he would make plans with his friends and refuse to see me. The sleep deprivation, the lack of proper food, the stress, and now his rejection was too much for me to handle. We began a group project and I got close to one of my team mates. Because we spent every waking hour for 4 weeks together, it felt good to have some sort of attention. We never did anything physical at all, it was all sort of emotional. My SO found out, and sparked another string of fights. In the middle of all this and between major projects, we booked a trip to another city to see a show. That's the weekend I got pregnant. 

I found out I was pregnant about a month after our trip. It was bittersweet. It felt as though everything that had been piling up had cleared and he and I loved each other again. We were definitely not expecting to get pregnant at all, but we're old enough that it's not the worse thing in the world that could've happened. When the morning sickness started and I couldn't get out of bed, I decided to drop out of school. It was a really hard first trimester. I was barely going to work, I was always getting sick, my bills were stacking up. I couldn't afford my insurance anymore, so I got on Medicaid, but my therapist doesn't accept it, so I had to pay for therapy out of pocket, which meant my weekly visits dropped to once a month. I didn't feel comfortable telling anyone just yet, so I dealt with all this in silence. SO was very supportive during this time and always there to comfort me when I could barely move from nausea. 

When the second semester began and I started feeling better, I finally had more energy to pull myself out of debt. I started applying to a bunch of new jobs and at my 5th month of pregnancy got a job as a contractor for the government with great benefits. My SO and I decided that we were stable enough to be able to afford moving in together, so we rented an apartment. When spring came, it brought along insane water retention and swelling. i started gaining a ton of weight and my feet swelled up so much that none of my shoes fit. I felt like a fucking parade float. My SO didn't want to tell anyone until we reached 20 weeks, so I didn't. 20 weeks came and went and he still didn't want to, so I was patient. Finally at 24 weeks he told all our friends. Everyone was shocked but happy, we were the first in our group of friends to have a baby. Even though everyone knew, I still felt really alone. I could talk about what it was like, but none of my friends really understood. Whatever. 

Third trimester hit, and I was growing more and more worried about maternity leave. The policy at my new job was that in order to get paid maternity leave, you had to work there for at least a year. I was freaking the fuck out about bills and stuff. My amazing supervisor kicked it into high gear and started the paperwork to convert me to a full government employee so I could get the benefits before I gave birth. I'd come home crying with anxiety one day and the next day be ecstatic with the latest update regarding my conversion. My emotions were all over the place. I was officially converted at 37 weeks pregnant, and gave birth at 38 weeks. It was like my baby knew that if she waited a little bit, we'd be fine. 

The birth was surprisingly easy. I had a feeling she would come 2 weeks early. My SO begged her to wait until after the baby shower and she did just that. I had been feeling Braxton-Hicks every 3-4 hours, so I knew it would happen any day but I wasn't worried. We got home from the baby shower, brought the presents up, I took a shower, and as I was getting ready for bed my water broke. All of a sudden I was having contractions every 2-3 minutes. I was freaking the fuck out. I had 38 weeks to wrap my head around the idea of having a baby, and it was suddenly time and I wasn't ready. I sat on the toilet with amniotic fluid pouring out of me while I had a full on panic attack. I was shaking and I couldn't breath, I felt like I was going to vomit and I had insane diarrhea. When my SO got on the phone with my OB, she told him to bring me to the hospital because I was in labor. He was calm and ready. I was losing my mind. I didn't want to leave the toilet because the fluid kept coming, but I didn't have a single pad on hand since I hadn't had my period in almost a year. I was sane enough to think of grabbing a diaper and we made our way to the hospital. We got there around 1:30 am, the checked my cervix and I was only 1 cm dilated. They told us to get comfortable because we would be there for hours. I lasted until about 10 am when I finally asked for the epidural. Once it kicked in, I was great. My OB happened to be the doctor on call, so we felt at ease. When it was time to push, she told us to get ready for a few hours of labor, but to everyone's surprise, it only lasted 30 minutes. My sweet baby girl was born. I was so dehydrated that I couldn't even cry but we were all emotional. I held my tiny and she looked at me with the widest and most curious eyes and I was instantly in love.

Then they moved us to the maternity ward and we were left to fend for ourselves. After checking the baby, they wrapped her up and brought her to the room. The next 48 hours were awful. Whenever I tried to feed her, it was the most painful thing I had ever felt in my life. Like her tiny mouth was full of battery acid. The nurses kept shoving her onto my breast and ignoring my pain. A lactation consultant came and told me that she wasn't latching right because breastfeeding shouldn't be painful (lie). We spent hours working at it. I eventually stopped complaining because none of the nurses cared that I was in pain. They never offered to give her formula, just left us to struggle through feedings. She only ever fell asleep out of exhaustion, and she woke up constantly due to hunger. I asked the lactation consultant about possibly pumping and she told me that I have to call my insurance because the hospital doesn't deal with renting pumps directly then left. Apparently, they have pumps in every room but that was never an option presented to us. After two days, we were cleared to go home. I was so ready to get out of that hospital room. 

The first week was brutal. We didn't sleep at all. She was barely eating and I was in excruciating pain. The effect of the pain medication had worn off and my vagina was in ruins. My nipples were sore and cracked, one started bleeding. But from being constantly dismissed at the hospital, I didn't call anyone or ask for help. She was constantly crying for food and I was in constant pain trying and failing to feed her. I broke down crying every time she had to eat. When she was able to get some sleep, my anxiety kicked into overdrive and I couldn't sleep. I began thinking about all the SIDS warnings and had it in my mind that she was going to choke and die. Any little coo she made I would jump out of bed and grab her. When her first pediatrician appointment came,  her doctor discovered she was pretty severely jaundiced due to malnutrition. She was born 5 lbs 15 oz and she had dropped down to 5 lbs. We had to take her to the emergency room for light therapy. Into the NICU she went. I felt like a complete failure. I only had my baby for 5 days and already I was killing her. 

When she was in the NICU, the nurses that were in charge of her care were like angels sent from heaven. They sat with me and watched me feed her, coached me through getting her to latch correctly, comforted me when the pain came, and introduced me to my first breast pump. My breasts were so full that when I pumped for the first time, I cried from the relief I felt. They were the first ones to give us a damn break and let us give the baby formula. My baby was so hungry she finished her first 2 oz bottle in less than 5 minutes. We couldn't stay with her overnight, so we went home without our baby. For 2 nights, the anxiety of her dying made me jolt awake every 20 minutes to check on her, only to cry myself to sleep when I realized she wasn't there. 

When she was finally released, I felt such relief. I thought all the bad experiences were over. My SO had managed to get 3 weeks of paternity leave, so we were great, until he had to go back to work. Luckily, my mom was on vacation for 2 weeks and she was over every single day to help me with the baby. She's let me sleep a bit and clean or cook something so I could eat. But those 2 weeks came and went in a blink of an eye and I had one last week to face by myself. I had huge anxiety about being left alone with her. I kept thinking I was going to drop her, or I'd fall sleep while feeding her, roll over, and crush her. Or go to the bathroom to pee and she'd choke to death while I was gone. I refused to sleep or eat or pee. I'd hold it until my SO came home from work then run to the bathroom. At this point, I was in so much pain from feeding her that I stopped breastfeeding altogether and only gave her formula or whatever I pumped. Mind you, the depression hit real fucking hard and I was really only pumping once or twice a day so my milk production plummeted. She would wake up and cry for food, and I'd freak out. What made it worse is that whenever I gave her formula, she would spit up these huge clumps of phlegm. when she napped, it sounded like she was choking. I went to her doctor with my concern and he told me it was normal, she'd get better with time. But as the days went by, she only got worse. She reached a point where she developed really severe eczema all over her face, it looked like someone had burned her. I took her back to the doctor and that's when we discovered she had cow's milk protein allergy. Once again, the feeling that I was killing my baby returned. We had to get rid of her regular formula and get her hypoallergenic formula. The doctor told me to stop giving her my milk altogether, but I had read online that if I stopped consuming dairy, it was ok, so I disregarded that instruction. I was determined to get her better, and what better remedy than breast milk. Unfortunately by this point, my milk was so depleted that I could only make 2 oz per day. Yet again, I felt like a complete failure. 

I started trying to breastfeed her again, only to find that it was 10x more painful than ever. Like her gums were made of a million cattle prods that attacked my nerve endings. It took everything in me to not scream from the pain whenever I fed her. This wasn't normal. I started getting random fevers and body chills, but I ignored them. My baby eating was more important than my comfort. 

While all this was happening, the problems with my SO picked up again. It started when he went back to work. I resented him for having time to escape our apartment, time away from the baby with other adults. I was stuck at home watching the baby and listening to her cry all day. When she'd sleep, I was too anxious to sleep with her, so I'd clean constantly to stay awake. Now, he's always been kind of messy, leaving dishes in the sink, paper towels around, nothing too crazy. But when I was left alone, the little things he did that never bothered me became the focus of my anger and frustration. I started resenting him for leaving a dirty dish in the sink, for leaving his socks on the couch, for not making the bed. The more I lashed out at him, the more he pulled away. Then the day came when he had a dinner with his coworkers. It took every fiber of my being to not rip him a new asshole. How the fuck could he think it's ok to leave me alone with OUR baby when I've spent every second of the last 5 weeks with her and he's free to go to work. This was an optional outing, and he chose to leave us and go have fun. Fun that I wasn't allowed to have. 

I kept telling myself that he deserved a night off, he had been amazing and super patient with me and my overwhelming emotions and anxiety. He constantly offered to watch the baby and give me a few hours to myself, to go out or sleep in. But all I felt when I considered taking him up on his offers were how bad of a mother I would be if I left my baby. So I never left my baby, and I blamed him when he wasn't to blame. He started to sense my resentment, and reached a point where he wasn't going to take my shit anymore. Instead of being understanding, he started to shut me out. 

After I reached 6 weeks pp, I was finally cleared to go back to work and resume normal activities. It was like he was given the green light to be a complete creep. He started constantly groping me and being super aggressive with his advances - but luckily he was still respectful enough to stop when I said no. When I did say no, he would get really irritated and ignore me for the rest of the day. He couldn't understand that just because the doctor said I was cleared, it didn't mean that I was ready to have sex again. I had gained 50 lbs during my pregnancy and was having a really hard time losing the weight. I felt like a disgusting blob of fat. None of my clothes fit me. I was covered in dark red stretch marks. Whenever I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I'd have to hold back the vomit from pure disgust. How could I have sex? Not to mention that when we did try just so I could get him to back off me for a while, we couldn't do it because it was too painful. So since he couldn't get more than a hand job here and there, he started being a complete asshole. I couldn't ask him to do anything without him getting an attitude. I complained to him about the paper towels he'd leave scattered around and he hit me back with ""well, the trash can is right there"" and walk away. 

That was last week. This week, I finally decided to go to the doctor for the pain in my breasts. Turns out I have a combination of mastitis and thrush - it wasn't just in my head. That's when everything started to bubble up to the surface. All the emotions I've suppressed for the last year came at me in full force. So Tuesday night I sat in bed and cried in the dark. My SO asked me what was wrong and I didn't want to tell him, but he insisted to I did. I spent an hour writing out everything, being very careful with my word choice so as to not sound like I was attacking him, he's very sensitive and takes everything personally. I thought I did an ok job, but he hit me back with an equally long text complaining about me and my attitude and how I never want to fuck him and he's neglected. I read the messages out to my therapist last night and even she almost started crying from his response. 

So now I'm sitting here at work (been back for 3 weeks now) on a new account I made so he wouldn't find it and letting it all out to you guys because I can't turn to him and I can't turn to my friends and I feel lost and alone and every couple of weeks I find another reason to think I'm killing my baby and I've reached a point where I feel like a literal cow. My SO comes home and he gets to sit with her and read and play and bond while I do the dishes and the laundry and the only time I have with my baby is when I try to feed her, which is not the perfect bonding experience because I'm in excruciating pain and when I can't take the pain anymore and I take away the boob, she starts screaming. I can't tell him because he'll just hit me back with more shit.",Postpartum_Depression,"10 weeks postpartum, losing my shit (super long, sorry)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/d3vbel/10_weeks_postpartum_losing_my_shit_super_long/,1568432626.0,2019-09-13 20:43:46,2.2649304960190374e+18

MumsGotNoMilk,"I got pregnant on accident. I was on birth control, but I’m in a loving and supportive relationship, and in a good place for a kid, I just wasn’t ready yet. I saved up money for a vacation, had dreams to buy a house and a new car... but now I’m using my money to cover the cost of not working for maternity leave. I had a life planned that didn’t involve having a kid for at least a couple years.

But when I got pregnant, I cried. I mourned the loss of that life I thought I’d have, and got myself ready for this new life ahead of me. It wasn’t entirely out of the picture, just out of sequence, and I kept telling myself that it was okay this way.

Pregnancy sucked. Morning sickness, swelling, gestational hypertension, constantly urinating, a three day hospital stay for complications during 2nd trimester, being treated differently just because you’re pregnant... I wasn’t a fan of this process, but it could really have been worse. I was also under a lot of stress because I started work in a new specialty just before I found out, and I go to school full time.

I was so excited when my contractions finally hit 4min apart. But then they stayed at 4min apart for three. Effing. Days. I couldn’t sleep, one time they gave me morphine to help me sleep and sent me home, so I got about 4-6hrs of sleep then but after over 24hrs of not sleeping and no progress (was not dilating this entire time), I came back in to get another dose to get some rest. My blood pressure was too high and they ended up inducing me. Exciting, right? I was finally going to get this thing that had been causing me pain and keeping me from sleep to stop. 

Well, we induce, got to 4cm and then I was asked if I wanted an epidural. Since I hadn’t any sleep going on 36 hours, I accepted. I thought a good nap in, I would have more energy for this labor thing.

Unfortunately I got a very rare complicated of the epidural that put me in immense pain, and then when they replaced that epidural, the same thing happened and I was in immense pain for 20+ hrs. I really should have opted for no meds for my birth at that point and had them take everything out, but I was already paralyzed, tired, and I couldn’t make decisions anymore at that point, I was in far too much pain. I barely progressed at all in those 22hrs. My water broke at some point during that time, I think they said 14 hrs from birth. When they finally removed the second failed epidural, they told me our best option at that point was an assisted delivery.

So I got a spinal block instead, since they couldn’t even examine me without pain. The pain of pushing was nothing compared to the pain everywhere else I felt. The spinal (which was very painful and took 30minutes to be placed) took that pain away for once, but it dropped my blood pressure and they had to administer emergent meds, my baby, nearly at the same time, was in distress, his heart rate was in the 200s and climbing. I had a stage 3 episiotomy. 

They pulled him out with forceps quickly and the room was silent, he was not crying and he was pale, dusky grey, even. I held him for a minute after they got him breathing again, but after all that, I didn’t know what to do. I imagined us being skin to skin, immediately trying to breast feed, but none of that was possible and they had to take him away to the NICU shortly after. We already agreed that if anything happened, my husband would be in the NICU with our baby, so that’s what he did. 

It was so strange to have a room full of people, and then have no one in seconds. It was just my nurse and I, and she got me all set up, I had to be straight cathed because I wasn’t peeing, and there was blood everywhere. She got me cleaned up as best she could and stayed with me. I had no baby. I had no husband. Not even a doctor stayed after.

I wish I could say that’s where it all ended, but I feel like I made some poor decisions even from here out. The neonatal specialist updated me and asked my opinion on breastfeeding vs formula feeding since his sugars were dropping, and we were separated. I told her if it was impossible for us to be together for breast feeding, as we were both in poor shape, then anything to have my baby fed was fine. My poor baby was in terrible pain for days after birth, but luckily not a bone was broken. We had a good latch together, but after a couple feeds, my nipples were raw, he was basically drinking my blood at that point. We found out he had a significant tongue tie, that inhibited his intake, which wouldn’t be able to get fixed for him to feed for 3 days, so we did our best with feeding and supplemented with formula as was suggested to us. His weight was just dropping too much.

Once we got his tongue fixed, and I had been pumping and trying to get keep my supply up, he was eating better. At our two week check, he gained enough weight that I was cleared to be able to try and breastfeed alone, however my production tanked never increased, despite constantly pumping and trying to breast feed. 

I don’t know if I want to continue breast feeding or not. I hate watching him struggle and be hungry while we tried to figure out how to feed him. I hated watching him be in pain day after day. But if I don’t breast feed, what was the point in putting him through the tongue clipping? How selfish do I have to be to have someone slice my child’s face, just to help with breast feeding, only to quit and give up on that plan anyway?

I felt defeated, because this whole journey has been nothing but one thing after another, nothing going as I envisioned it, even in the slightest. I feel robbed of the life I could have had to some degree, I feel robbed of my body, I look in the mirror and I don’t recognize myself anymore, and I feel robbed of these wonderful experiences everyone talks about as a new mom. I feel a bit rejected now too, because he used to latch so easily but now he only wants the bottle, and when he does nurse from me, I know he doesn’t get much... I feel like a human pacifier, I don’t even fulfill my duty as food producer.

None of this is my son’s fault, and I feel so incredibly guilty. And I feel worse because I’ve had no appetite since giving birth, I have been forcing myself to eat and drink just a bit each day, and I’m tired of crying every day. I don’t want any more problems, I just want to bond with my son and focus on my little family with my husband, and move forward smoothly. But nothing about this is smooth.

Since my OB caught on about the not eating, she has referred me to the social worker, after diagnosing me with PPD, and will be attending my first group meeting on Tuesday. 

I can’t wait to finally feel ok again. Or at least have something go right.

I would look up symptoms and kind of be in denial telling myself it could just be baby blues, but today I think I realized this could be ppd.

At the hospital, the doctor told her that if she wasn’t right there then it would have been a SIDS case. 
This has sent my anxiety through the roof. I’m constantly checking on my LO and making sure she’s breathing, barely sleeping, and when I do I’m having nightmares of me finding her just like that.

Brighidhecate,"I have a three week old. There have Ben two nights where he just hasn’t slept at all and has just screamed. I have put him down in his cot and had to just leave him to cry for five minutes because I couldn’t cope with the screaming in my ears anymore. 

Partner gets up maybe once a night with him, on a good night. Many nights he doesn’t get up at all. Most often he will wake me if I don’t respond fast enough.

Last night he walked in when I had put him down for five minutes while screaming. By that stage it was 2am. I had been cluster feeding and holding him since 6pm. I needed a goddamn minute. Well. Partner comes in, sees baby crying and flips it saying I must have PPD because who would leave their kid screaming and not wrapped. Baby was literally in the cot for three minutes.

Now I want to move out. Having a newborn is hard work and I don’t appreciate having someone using my history of anxiety as a weapon to claim I am an awful mother. On the other hand I have heard of people who have PPD and don’t realise it.

megmeg29,"Throughout my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression; I used to self medicate (with marijuana) as I will not go on any actual medications - and eventually was able to manage and cope effectively by changing my lifestyle and mindset. I quit smoking weed and felt like I was in a good place.

Then when I got pregnant the anxiety started. I prepared myself for the postpartum period as much as I could , but could never be truly prepared. I worked with a postpartum nutritionist and coach, went to therapy and practiced a lot of self care from the very beginning. Just recently my benefits expired and I no longer have access to these support resources and I feel myself getting very low.

I don’t have a support system at all. My relationship with my mother is not existent, and the relationship with my mother in law is more stressful the helpful. I’m the first of my friends to have babies. 

I am so disinterested in anything that made me happy before. I feel like I wake up every day with a dark storm cloud over my head. I fight with my husband constantly and feel unfulfilled at home all day living the same day on repeat. Then I feel guilty because my daughter is the cutest fricken thing and all I’ve wanted my entire life was to be a mother.

My husband tries to be encouraging telling me to set small goals , start a bit of a routine... that’s the only way things are gonna change if I start doing things for myself. I used to work out 4 days a week, eat healthy, appreciate my body. Now I feel like I just hate myself, and soothe myself through eating junk food and watching tv. I don’t feel motivated to do absolutely anything good for myself. I understand that these things will help shift things but right now ... I just feel like I don’t have it in me.

I am just feeling so alone, and wishing I could run away from my life. I would never ever kill myself because I could never do that to my daughter or husband, but I am having such a hard time in this challenging season of life. I want so badly to just feel good. Stop wishing things would change and just accept each day as it is. 

I should be grateful, I get to spend every day with my daughter- I’m on maternity leave; I can’t even imagine how the mothers in the states are coping back at work so soon; then I feel even guiltier - like it could always be worse.

The only “positive self care” I do is take a bath, like three times a day... I would just live in the bath if I could. I’m constantly checking my phone, like I feel seriously addicted, just trying to escape. I know I’m going to look back and miss these days so why can’t I just live in the moment and appreciate it.

I wish I could just cure this depression; but I feel like I don’t have the energy to. I don’t want to go on medications, I want to find a way to heal this naturally and permanently.

thunderbirdandspice,"Okay so, as the title says, I’m having a baby in about a month. I’ve spent a lot of time preparing baby things, but kind of postponing the after-birth me-things. 

The thing I’m most worried about is how my mental health will be. I don’t want to seem like I’m jumping the gun by *assuming* I’ll have PPD, but my mental health has always been a struggle my whole life.

I struggle with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, generalized anxiety, and I’m in recovery for an eating disorder. I stopped all my meds when I found I was pregnant, though I know some meds are safe, I just didn’t feel comfortable with that. My doctor is not the most um...informative you could say. She’s just told me I should maybe set up an appointment with a psych doc for some time after the birth and hasn’t talked to me about it after that.

As with a lot of posts I see on here, my boyfriend is also the ‘let’s not talk about emotions’ type, and very much the kind that wants to rest when he gets home, tears are irritating to him. I’m not here to complain about this or seek help fr him, I’m just saying my mental health will be my issue to deal with.

happymama23,"If you know me in real life please don’t bring this up to my family. 

I’m in need of a vent. 

I haven’t been happy since birth. I’ve known I’ve needed to get help but I have a hard time talking face to face with my emotional issues. I post on here, feel validated and supported, then move on until the next night. I used to express my depression through anger but now I’m just quiet. I feel like just giving up and running away. I’m very self aware I eat mood enhancing foods and listen to upbeat music. Today was just a out of the ordinary tough day. And it’s a long story....

A few events have happened to lead up to me texting my ex boyfriend / friend of over 5 years. I saw a license plate that said CRLSBD on it which is where I met S. My dog is dying which I got when I was with S. I’m moving and I’ve found several items given to me by S. So I texted him and he talked for almost 6 hours with back to back texts. I laughed like I haven’t in months I smiled so hard it hurt I was so happy to be talking to S. Our relationship should’ve stayed just a friendship but we were friends so long we took it to the next level and it ended terribly. It’s been almost 6 years since we have broken up. I’ve thought about him and fake texted him a million times. My love for him was strictly on a friendship level and still is I still care deeply for him. Then this morning happened. 

So this morning I woke up around maybe 1400... not that out of the usual for me. Somedays I don’t get out of bed until my SO is about to be home. I texted S asking if we could maybe be friends. He said no but instead of leaving it at that he started attacking me verbally. I took deep breaths and told him I respected his decision. Honestly I’m not hurt about that. I am disappointed but it’s been so long without him I am okay I don’t feel like I’m missing anything. So I continue with my day. 

This past week my SOs little brother has been with us. So I’ve been cooking home cooked dinners each night and letting them play video games while I clean, do laundry, take care of the baby, and cook. I’ve been silent for the most part and pretty well behaved. Today I made scalloped potatoes, steamed broccoli, three rib eye steaks, and honey crescents. No thankyou. No that was delicious. No gratitude. Nothings. They didn’t even do dishes they’re still out on the counter. 

It was 2130 so I said ok it’s time to get ready for bed. They rush in to the bedroom and said no no we have to finish this video game. They turned on the tv and it was a brand new soccer match 0000! I said hell no it’s bed time and turned off the tv. I walked out and they turned it on again so I unplugged everything and threw the controllers in to the closet. They locked me out of the room with the baby. With. The. Baby. Now I’m pissed because I take care of her 24/7!!!!! When he is home it’s his turn. So I walked away from her....

I went into the bathroom started a bath and I’m still in the bath almost 3 hours later. I realized I haven’t had any me time since before our daughter was born 14 months ago. My daughters screaming so my SO runs out to get her and asks wth I’m doing so I said taking a bath. In retaliation he goes and puts on my show in the living room and blasts it so I don’t have peace or quiet. He’s in the bedroom playing his video games. I can hear our daughter crying because she’s tired and hungry (breastfed) so I y’all at them to give her a bottle of formula - stashed free samples from the hospital just in case of emergencies. SO called me a selfish brat for locking myself into the bathroom. 

2300 rolls around... he finds the key to the bathroom and turns on the light. He accuses me of hiding his phone. He has our crying daughter on him as he yells at me. I said I don’t know where it is because our daughter hides our stuff all of the time. He says I’m childish and acting like a brat. I said whatever. I said why don’t you ever care why I’m upset why is everything about you? And he scoffed at me saying I’m only mad because they played video games instead of getting ready for bed. I said no. He said is it because S didn’t want to be friends with you I said no. I said why don’t you look deeper in to my actions and words and find out why I’m upset? He said just tell me. I said no you’re being lazy. He said you’re always calling me names and coming up with excuses. I said not true. He walked out and said whatever you’re a brat. 

Haven’t talked since. I’ve been very vocal to him in the past about being depressed. I’ve even told him straight out I’m not happy anymore. He doesn’t care. He just carries on like I don’t matter. He complains that I don’t do anything all day. He complains that he has to get up at 0730 to go to work. He complains that he has to stay up with me so I can pump with him (because that’s when I am the most depressed). He complains that we only do what I want to do and I’m bossy (not true). 

I’m really lost here. I don’t want to give up on our relationship but I just don’t have any fight left in me so I’m quiet. I feel like I’m just washing out in to the deep sea and no one will miss me. I’m tired of being the only one who cares. I cook I clean I breast feed I feel like I’m doing everything yet it’s all nothing because I don’t wake up to go to work. To top it all off our lease is up in a few weeks and we have no where to go and blames me because I refuse to live in a dump.

What bothers me more is that I have repeatedly told him I am not in good shape mentally. 

Do you think that text was a jab at me? He has not been supportive, he’s actually a big part of the problem.

Babislug,"I believe I am experiencing PPD. I started seeing a therapist when my son was only 3 mos old and brought up the topic with her then, and at that time she stated that it was early for me to be saying that and PPD usually surfaces at about 6mos postpartum. I’ve seen her regularly since then (about every 6 weeks) and each time she sees me she suggests a bunch of reading or self care exercises. It’s a lot to take on when I have two little ones at home ... I’ve not been able to make time for that like I should. 

Now I have a 1yo (well, he’s turning 1 next week) and a 2.5yo, and I’m feeling overwhelmed 100% of the time. I’m drowning in laundry, dishes, cleaning ... it’s all I can do to get them ready and drop them off at daycare in the morning. Then I delay picking them up because I don’t want to be alone with them. My toddler is so very needy right now, constantly asking for things or whining to get what he wants. My younger son is so very clingy and will cry if I try to put him down or hand him off to daddy. I’m off for summer right now (I’m a teacher) but I don’t feel like I’m getting the rest I need to be able to handle the coming school year as a mother of 2 super needy little ones.

My husband seems to be pulling away, and I’m not managing this very well. He’s communicating less, helping me less, getting frustrated easily with the kids just like I am. I am constantly upset with him about something, but when I try and talk with him about this I feel like I can’t identify exactly what needs to change. 

I feel so tired all the time. I’m not sleeping well, I’ve had a strange appetite for months (either not hungry and skipping meals, or else ravenous and snacking all day long). I am reading the texts this therapist recommended but they don’t seem to be helping. I don’t have the energy or desire to do the self care things she suggests. I don’t like spending time with my kids ... I just want out, really. 

How long can I expect this to continue? When did it start getting better? When did you start feeling like a better mom, or not resent time you have to spend with your kids because it feels like it’s taking everything from you?",Postpartum_Depression,"I’m struggling so hard right now - I don’t want to be with my kids, and I feel like the worst mother.

RedheadBunBun,"My daughter is almost 5 months old now and I think I have been dealing with PPD since bringing her home. I had a difficult run in high school where I self-harmed for 5 years, but after meeting my now husband it has been off and on throughout our 9 years together. Honestly, every time there has been a slip-up I have never told him. Just a few weeks ago, during the 4 month sleep regression, there was a night where I just completely broke down. I yelled at our daughter and put her on the bed, ran out of the room and beat my arm against a door frame. The only way I was able to compose myself afterwards was to self-harm (which my husband does not know about). Since then I have done it two more times. I saw my doctor finally, but only mentioned thoughts of self-harm. She prescribed Zoloft for me and then after 4 days I stopped producing milk. That made me feel even worse, so I stopped taking the medication. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I probably need to open up to someone, but it is so ingrained in me to not. Even in high school I kept it from my family for those entire 5 years, and I've never received any positive interactions from anyone when discussing it. And with this being such a difficult time right now, I'm honestly just thinking to myself to go ahead and doing it. Since quitting my job and becoming a stay-at-home-mom my entire day is tending to her. Neither my husband or I get time to ourselves to relax or do the things we use to enjoy, so I end up feeling depressed and tightly wound all day. I feel like self-harm is the only thing I have for that immediate release. Unfortunately my husband is just as stressed now that he is solely responsible for us financially; I really can't open up to him about this and have him worried about me even more than he already is. I understand I've gone through times like this before, and it has passed. Does that sound terrible? Has anyone else struggled like this before?

concernedhusbnd,"My wife of 5 years wants a divorce.  Our daughter is 2.  

She had a hard time breastfeeding, and it took a major toll on her when her supply ran out.  
She went from being the most responsible, caring, loving person to an angry, short tempered asshole in what seemed like overnight.
I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her for the longest time.

About a year and ago, my wife started line dancing to get out of the house and get some exercise. She found a great, supportive community of female friends she’d never really had before.  I was assured it was a “girls thing” and not to worry about anything.  “This type of dancing was technical, not sexual.”

I didn’t think twice that she was out until 2am 4 nights a week, because she said it made her happy and she felt “whole” again.

She would talk about how much guilt she would feel for wanting to do this for herself.  How she felt judged by people when she would tell them she went out at night.  I couldn’t protest, for fear that I would add to that guilt by expressing any concerns I may have as a husband.  

Fast forward to a month ago and she tells me she doesn’t love me anymore, and has feelings for a guy she dances with.  Said she “could pretend like she was another person” with him. 

I am blindsided.  Her family and friends are shocked.

We went to couples counseling, but she started it off by saying she does not want to salvage the relationship.  Therapist took her at her word and we talked about scheduling and calendars the entire time we saw him, until he finally told us we didn’t need him anymore.

The hardest part in all of this, has been our day to day relationship.  It’s never been better.  
It was like a giant cloud had been lifted off of her shoulders.  
We can talk to each other again, and laugh.  
But it hasn’t changed the way she feels.

Now that this is all in the open, I am cognizant of my own shortcomings in the relationship, and have been very vocal in my desire to better myself not just for her, but for me as well.  I want to do the work.  

She does not. 

No matter how great it has been between us, and how much love and support I give and show her, she still wants to remain separated, and to be with this other person.

Tinyjalepeno,"So I’m curious about some things and I just want to state I have realized I know very little on postpartum depression so I apologize if I sound naive, ignorant, or offensive to anyone with the questions I have. 

I am curious as to how common postpartum depression is? If it is something that must be diagnosed specifically as a mental illness or something like you have been feeling down since having a baby so you can say it’s postpartum? Does it vary? Is it something that some women throw around lightly? And so sorry if that sounds offensive, but I’m curious if some people treat it lightly as people did with add or adhd. So many people claim to have add or adhd, but in reality they were never diagnosed and really don’t have either they just get distracted and want to say they have add or adhd. I’m curious if a woman who feels blue for a week after pregnancy could say she suffered from post partum? Or is that just simply not the case with post partum? 

I hope my questions don’t offend anyone, but honestly at the moment I don’t have insurance (have to wait till November to activate) so I can’t go to the doctors to be fully informed just yet. I realize my knowledge on this is severely lacking and once again hope I do not offend anyone, but these are serious questions I’ve been thinking about lately.

neodanam86,"I had my beautiful, perfect son in March, but I'm so unhappy.


I feel so guilty; on the outside I probably have everything a mom/person could want. My well behaved gorgeous son, a well paying job to go back to (2.5 days away), an attentive dad to our son who loves me too, a nice apartment...trouble is I just don't feel happy at all. 


I wake up miserable (whatever number of hours I've slept) and sit alone all day with my newborn, half the time trying to get up the motivation to get him ready and get outside of my apartment - which although it's big, inexpensive (for New York state) and homey - feels like a prison to me. I feel so alone. My boyfriend works nights so we rarely see each other, and when he leaves for work at 9:30 anxiety fills me up. I hate, hate, hate being here alone - but there's no helping it. He has to make money. My boyfriend also has always had intimacy issues so the time we have together is sparsely sprinkled with the kind of kisses you give your grandmother and a tiny amount of touching, prior to last week we hadn't had sex in 5 months. I cry practically every day because I feel he doesn't find me attractive, never did, and never will. When we had sex it was of course rushed. I didn't even get to look at his body and he barely touched me. I realize we have a child now, but sex is one thing that keeps me sane and I can't even have any.


I'm on the verge of vomiting from anxiety of going back to work. I have worked for my current company for 6 years and they have walked all over me the entire time. When we discussed coming back they told me I could cut my hours, then when I said I wanted to they promptly told me it wasn't an option. In the past I have been bullied to the point of tears and told I could not go to an important therapy appointment because my supervisor wasn't there (that caused me to discontinue treatment). I asked to please take days off preemptively for my son's doctors appointments and they said no to that as well. My boyfriend simply says, ""find a new job, it will be easy for you"" but to me it feels like the most daunting task imaginable - I put in applications and then hope and pray that they won't call me. 


I have almost no support outside of my boyfriend. My mom helped me around the time I gave birth but for the most part that has gone out the window. She can only do anything in a specific time frame and she never offers. I recently had a falling out with a ""friend"" who offered to help me, but she was a constant disappointment blowing me off at every turn only to then turn on me, saying I was delusional and a terrible person. It ended with her telling me to fuck off, that I should never have had a child, and to lose her number - that one fucked me up for days - I'm still not completely over it. I can't really ask most of my other friends for help, I have too much guilt to make myself do so. I've always done everything alone.

Then there's breast feeding. My baby was given a bottle so early and started having trouble latching I gave it up. I've been pumping since, and I got good results in the beginning, then I got my period and it's trickled to an ounce per session. I feel like such a failure because I can't even make enough milk for one feeding at a time and I have no back stock for when I go back to work. I also desperately miss actually breast feeding - I know I kind of blame my boyfriend for this subconsciously - but I know he was onlubtrying to help me since I was in so much pain. Now I hate pumping and my nipples hurt every day. I'm putting off pumping as I write this even though my breasts are heavy and uncomfortable.


There are nights where I lose my temper and then worry that my son will be fucked up because I cry, sob and scream around him. I feel so much guilt. I look at him and see the most perfect child in the world, and can't help loving him more than anything in this world. I don't sleep well because I'm so afraid he will die when I'm sleeping. I was able to sleep mornings up until now, but I will return to work soon (normal hours so no sleeping in) and I'm worried about being too scared to sleep.


All in all I feel so lost and scared. I know with time some of the issues will resolve with time, and I definitely have been contemplating therapy but it still feels hopeless. I never thought I would feel this way when I had a baby, but I do.

Kalldaro,"I'm a stay at home mom with a three month old and a 6 year old and 4 year old. My husband often works late.

Ever since the kids got out if school I feel overwhelmed. My four year old is having trouble adjusting to his new sibling and he has been acting up. And he did not do that prior to the new baby. He kept knocking things over today and one was a TV dinner table and a glass shattered.

We recently found out that he is partially deaf and he got tubes in his ear. He had been getting speech therapy for years with little to know improvement. After the surgery he's been saying more words. But it's so hard to work with him because the baby constantly wants to be held. I tried a sling but when he gets excited he flails his arms and I have to protect my daughter.

I don't think I have ppd but I think it might be developing. I had it with a previous pregnancy and some of those feelings are coming back.

I tried to get help with my mom. But she just laughs and says that all moms go through this.  Last time when I had ppd, I asked for help and she said that she couldn't because that would would be enabling me.

I just feel so alone and I feel like there is no help out there. And I wish my mom was like other moms who would take any chance they could get to spend time with their grandchildren.

absolll,"I have dealt with anxiety/depression/ADD my whole life. I've done a ton of therapy and been on medication for a few years. I've suffered from alcoholism and addiction. I've been clean and sober for over a year now, and it has been quite an eventful year. I got sober and found out 2 months later I was 6 weeks pregnant. My daughter was born at 30 weeks after an emergency c-section due to placental abruption. She stayed in the NICU for 49 days before coming home with us. During her stay my MIL, who I live with, had a stroke and my partner and I took care of his 80 year old alcoholic father.

In my heart I know I don't want to give her up, but I just can't shake this feeling. The last few days I have felt like dying. When I drive, I imagine being hit by another car. Tonight I was wondering what pills we had in the house. I was also getting ready to write a will. I know I do not actually want to die. I have worked so hard for the life I have. I love my partner and our family. But these thoughts are so intrusive. I tried talking to him about it tonight, but he is a man of few words so it really wasn't helpful.

crazytownpopulation1,"I do not have Postpartum but I do live with 
severe depression. My cousin’s wife died last night and we believe it was a direct result of Postpartum. She was 24 and always so great to me and my family. My dad died in January and she sent beautiful messages to me and was always so sweet. She was like a hippie flower child full of optimism. At least on the surface. 

She stopped coming around family gatherings and I found out that she had not been very nice to my cousin since their baby boy had been born. She had also taken to being mean to his two daughters that he has full custody of and that she used to be amazing with. She’s a big reason why he has full custody because she supported him and stood by him through all of the court battles. However, after the birth, she became physically and emotionally abusive towards my cousin. 

He loved her so much. He fought for her in every sense of he word. He tried so hard to get her to see a counselor, to go to family counseling, to stop drinking and using pills (she had a drinking problem when they met and they both stopped drinking for years... I didn’t find out about the pills until today). Not long ago he reached out to find a divorce lawyer. And I know it killed him. He’s been through so much but he had finally got his family, his amazing job, and everything was going great... until it wasn’t. 

Last night she was out drinking. He went to pick her up and take her home so she was safe. He put her to bed and went to the couch. He went back to check on her a little while later and she was not breathing. He tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We don’t know yet if she asphyxiated or overdosed. I just can’t imagine what those girls and my cousin are going through. Their son is too young and it probably won’t effect him as much, but the girls have been through so much between their absent mother and then pending divorce. 

So I want to show my support and help in any ways that I can. I’ve always tried to watch for signs in my friends because I know the symptoms are the same as depression. If you know of any good charities to give to that support this cause, please share. 

And as someone on the outside, please reach out. If I would have known the extent of it, I would have tried to talk to her about it. I didn’t know until they agreed on a divorce. I know it’s hard to reach out, I have a hard time taking care of myself when it gets really bad. Just know that people out there love you and want you to take care of yourself.

ALC8915,"I was doing fine and am now 6 weeks postpartum.

I would say my moodiness started last week when my husband mentioned something about the house not being clean.  It started a huge fight and was crying and saying how all these expectations are unreasonable.

This week I really messed up, I am on maternity leave and decided to sign into my work emailed see what was going on.  I saw an email addressed to me and I flipped out and included my director.  I saw a lot of changes happening in the company and it just caused me to feel really out of control.  It was causing me so much anxiety, I was getting insomnia. I definitely offended people with my emails and got a scathing email back from my director.

Then I started getting really weepy and crying about it.  I've since sent another email apologizing and letting them know my postpartum period has been difficult.

jessmayfish,"My little bub turned one week old today. FTM. I had a pretty crappy labour. I was Induced at 40 weeks due to high blood pressure, induction caused intense contractions but slow dilation, 37 hour labour, baby position back-to-back, almost had c-section, gave birth in theater room via episiotomy and VE birth. Bub ended up with a skin tear on the top of her head from the vacuum. She is okay now, but it caused her to have a fairly high level of jaundice. I ended up with two stitches, and a nasty hemorrhoid which is making my life hell.

I just want to know when everything feels “normal” again? I know my life will never be the same, but I am barely coping. I feel like a dairy cow trapped in the house running on less than 2 hours sleep a day. I absolutely love my little girl, most the time I think she’s perfect. But I feel like I’m mourning my old life. I miss freedom. I miss sleeping for more then 2-3 hours. Because of bub’s jaundice she needs to be feed every 3 hours max with boob and then a bottle top up, so my husband can’t help too much. I’m so angry that he is getting 6-7 hours sleep  most nights. I’m so goddamn tired. I try sleeping during the day when I can, but between frequent feedings and pumping, it’s so damn hard. 

Do other mums feel like this? When does it get better? I haven’t wanted any visitors, I don’t want people to see me. I spend half my time crying, especially during the night.

greatwhitekoala,"My daughter is almost 3 months old. Lately I’ve been feeling like she doesn’t love me the way a child should love their mother. I breastfeed and pump every so often just for when she goes to my moms which is about once a week. When she’s home with me she’s not a miserable baby but she’s definitely not happy, I get some smiles and coos but have never made her laugh. When she’s with my mom she laughs and smiles constantly, I’m happy that she’s happy but honestly it hurts my feelings a little that I can never make her that happy. When she spends the day with my mom and then comes back to me she usually cries for about 30 min straight and also refuses to latch. She doesn’t like to snuggle with me or when I give her kisses. She doesn’t look for me when someone else is holding her and she never cries when I leave. She sleeps better when I put her in her crib in the other room other than next to my bed. 
     The first night in the hospital my mom stayed with me and held her for most of the night because I was so tired from 22 hours of labor and because she was so excited to be a grandma, but I feel like that may have made my daughter bond with her instead of me and maybe thinks that’s her mother.

MajesticAioli,"My sister has always struggled with depression. I was worried for her through her pregnancy when she had to go off her medication. Things got really rough, but we all supported her and she got through it. She had all the best intentions of doing what she could to avoid PPD, knowing she was at a higher risk. As a first time mom, she struggled with breast feeding and he had trouble latching, which gave her blisters and it became too painful. I think this started the PPD, she felt like she was poisoning him by giving him formula and cried about it a lot. 

Another trigger is that they only have friends out there, the closest family members are 4,000-6,000 miles away. The family would love to help if they were closer, but the friends, most of them childless, are less willing to help out, which leaves her feeling trapped and alone. They live in one of the most expensive cities in the US and while her husband has a good job, he's been working a lot of extra shifts so that she can work fewer shifts and stay home with their son; daycare isn't an option due to high costs.  She has expressed how she feels like she's trapped at home all the time with her son. Due to the shifts her husband works and the nature of his job, her son (6 months) also doesn't sleep through the night because she doesn't let him cry it out, instead she soothes him  within 5 minutes of him crying, she's on very little sleep because if this. 

Over the last few weeks, our text conversations have grown darker (on her end). I try to change her perspective on how she sees thing, but it's of no use. Last week, I finally got our parents involved and asked them to reach out to her husband, because while claiming she had spoke to him about her concerns and that ""he doesn't"" care"", typically means she brushed the surface of her concerns and he didn't think it was a big deal; she's always been like that, we always have to encourage her to let it all out. Plus he's very caring and to hear him brushing it off didn't sound like he was given the full picture. 

She had been telling me things like, ""my son is better off without me, his daddy will take great care of him"", to which I pointed out he struggles to handle him when she has her two 4 hour shifts every week. He's not a bad dad, he's just nervous and also a first time parent. He also has BPD that gets really bad if he's stressed and has little sleep, and I also tried to point this out, that if he has an episode, no one will be there for their son (legitimately my mom would fly out there to help, but I wanted her to see the bigger picture). She also said things like, ""If I wasn't such a chicken about killing myself, I'd be dead right now"" and "" All I think about is killing myself all day long"". I guess I just assumed it was all talk. 

Yesterday morning, she sent text messages to myself and our other sister. I don't know if they were intended to be cries for help, or to pass on a message to her son when he was older, but she knew I don't usually check my phone until my break at 9:40am and that our other sister starts work a lot later and wouldn't see it right away. Who knows if she was even thinking about this when she sent it. Her message came in at 6:24 am and I noticed an alert and read the message at 6:27, only because I never get messages that early, and felt like it was off. 

My sister's text messages informed me that she had taken all the pills in their apartment and was waiting to die and to tell her son she loved him more than anything in the world. (I knew it had to be real because she had trouble typing it and even autocorrect couldn't figure it out). And this is where I feel like I failed her: I should have thought to get up, go to somewhere quiet and call the police in her city. Instead I took a screenshot and messaged my dad and mom (they would both be up then) and her husband (he was working). THEN I thought to call the police but I didn't want to confuse them or delay it, and figured the 3 no responses I got from them were because they were handling the situation. As it turns out none of them saw it, they all received my text by 6:28am. My dad saw it at 6:45am and turned around to go back home. My other sister got up at 7am, saw it and called the police in their city. I feel like she was unresponsive for so long because I didn't react the way I should have. 

I know I shouldn't be beating myself up over this, but it's hard not to feel partially at blame. I feel like everyone involved probably privately feels the same way about my actions. Other thoughts that crossed my mind when I thought about calling were (1)  I wouldn't have been able to clearly state the issue to them from balling my eyes out, (2)  I would have been so eerily calm about it that it wasn't taken seriously. And finally, (3)  I thought about how she's an adult and will they even listen to me, I mean when adults run away and you report them missing, they tell you there's not much that can be done about it because adults can make their own decisions. 

My biggest fear is that she will have some type of lasting condition that could have been avoided if I reacted differently, when in all actuality she caused it in the first place.  

My mom is with them now, her son slept through the whole ordeal, EMS arrived in time, she is alive. She was in a coma for 26 hours in the Cardiac ICU. Initially when she woke up, she didn't recognize anyone, but now she's talking and eating.

mcbw2019,"I don’t really know how to feel. She was nice and even complimentary of me reaching out, but she said how sometimes this type of conversation could lead to women getting their baby taken away. I can’t really explain how distraught I felt when she said that. 

I told her how I had a few unwanted intrusive thoughts about hurting my baby. I explained to her that they horrified me and that’s why I was there. Her questions were necessary, but felt suggestive. She asked if I were plotting or planning to hurt him and I firmly explained that I was not and that wasn’t the case at all. I don’t want to hurt my baby. I have no desire to. I love him more than life itself! I just have fears of him getting hurt.


Toward the end of the conversation she did tell me it was normal and happened to a lot of women and stuff. I flat out asked her if I needed to worry about my baby being taken away and she said no. But I’m still anxious and kind of regretting reaching out. She is having a social worker call me next week to check in. I don’t like that I have been assigned to a social worker. I don’t like that I am a “case”. I really pride myself on good parenting and a healthy family dynamic. That bothers me.

Tsiprasisamalaka,"I just need to vent.

My daughter is 15 months old and I’ve been trying to deal with PPD on my own since she was born. Its a long story, but I like in a different country in a tiny village and if I got help for it, everyone would find out and its not accepted as a real thing and I’d be the crazy person of the village.

I’m struggling so hard. My mantra since day 1 has been it will get easier soon. Days and days have gone by and its only getting harder. I’m 25 and feel like I’m 60. I literally don’t know if my daughter is just the worst, most difficult child in the world or if thats how I’m perceiving her. Sometimes I feel like she HATES ME! When my husband babysits her when I’m teaching and I come home she starts screaming because she obviously prefers my husband. Sometimes when she screams I want to scream at the top of my lungs. I’d be lying if I said I’ve never screamed or completely lost it and bawled my eyes out. 

And then she comes over all upset and goes “mama?” And strokes my head and kisses me and I feel terrible for being such a mess of a mother. 

This morning I actually had the worst thought and I think I must be the only person in the whole world who could possibly think something like this. My daughter is sick with a runny nose and cough, and sometimes she coughs so bad that she throws up. It was 5 am and I heard her coughing violently in her sleep and this thought just randomly came to mind like, “if she throws up and chokes and no one realizes, I’d get a divorce and have my life back.” Immediately I got up and sure enough, she was on the verge of throwing up, which I helped her with because I promise I DO LOVE MY DAUGHTER! 

But what the hell is wrong with me?! When will this go away! I feel like PPD isn’t supposed to last this long.

atomicassface,"I gave birth in January and started feeling depressed shortly after. I lay awake at night thinking about my daughter and how she’s going to grow up and when that happens, I won’t be able to protect her anymore. I cry thinking about how I’m going to die and leave her alone in the world. 

I never expected to be a mom and I feel like I’m mourning the life that I used to have. All of my friends want to go out and party and don’t seem to understand how much having a child has changed my life. My mom was a drug addict and an alcoholic and it really fucked me up. I don’t ever want to be like she was so I don’t really want to go out with any of my friends anymore. 

I’m a SAH mom but I still work from home which is really overwhelming. I feel like I never get time to relax because I’m constantly taking care of my baby, doing chores, and keeping up with my job. I feel so lonely, the only adult contact I have on most days is with my boyfriend who doesn’t even like me anymore. Our relationship was on the rocks before I got pregnant and now that the baby is here, we’ve grown so distant, I feel like we’re strangers. Our lease is up in September so I think we’re going to call it quits and go our separate ways. To be able to afford a home, I’m going to have to move out of state or move back in with my parents.

She is a germaphobe and I have been ok living with her up until today. While I was making dinner in the kitchen and I was handling 3 pots at the same time. One is soup, one is boiling water to cook noodle and another one is fried egg. To finish up the soup, I went to the fridge to get a bowl of precut vegetables to be added into the soup. She got very upset because:

1. I did not rinse the vegetables before putting them into the soup. 
2. While I was putting the vegetables into the soup, the bowl was hovering over the skillet with fried eggs. 
3. I did not follow her instructions. She told me to put the fried eggs on dining table once it is done but I didn’t. 

She later said she does not want to eat any of those because the dishes are dirty/contaminated. She also questioned my ability to follow her instructions and asking why I ignore her instructions. 

I snapped. I have had enough. I threw the pot with hot water on the kitchen floor, saying that I’m not going to do anything anymore. I also mentioned that she needs help with her OCD. 

I am depressed, I do not know what to do right now.

deadblinger,"I (22F) gave birth to my first baby at 17 weeks (16 gestation). I can’t do anything anymore. It’s a daily struggle to brush my teeth or get out of bed or do anything worth while. Its been over a month but nothing has changed. It seems to only be getting worse. 

A little backstory, I met my s/o the last week of September 2018 and I found out I was pregnant Nov. 19th of 2018, after being in a car accident and sent to the hospital. We moved in together in Dec. of 2018. We left VA and drove to CO the first day of February to be with his family as we both were clueless on how to start a family and I didn’t have any to lean on. His family are wonderful, considerate, kind people but he grew up vastly different than I. Both of his parents are married and in love, he is wholly supported as well as his other siblings and I have never seen my parents in the same room nor been supported by them. 
Two weeks after knowing his parents, a few months knowing my s/o we lost our baby. 

My boyfriend is a great person. During my pregnancy he did (quite literally) everything I asked. During birth he was incredibly strong. Amongst other things, I often feel discredited when I say I gave birth because my baby wasn’t full term. But none the less, it was the most traumatic and terrifying thing I have ever been through. 

A month later and all I do is imagine putting little baby arms in her clothes and what she would be playing with or how tired I would be. I mix our faces together and come up with a million faces that could be hers. I wonder what fads she would fall into and what fashion choices she would choose as a teenager. I daydream about sending her off to school and how it would be the perfect school. 
I dream about touching her, something I never got to do. 

I got no answers from my doctors. I have no reason of why she passed. 
I left the hospital friday and Monday as I was headed to the funeral home to pick out an urn, my doctor called my saying my HIV test came back inconclusive. 
I had to get additional testing to confirm if i was positive or negative. I cried for ever. I thought “oh my god i’ve killed my baby and i’ve ruined my boyfriends life.” 
Everything felt like my fault. I just knew she died because of that night i gave in and drank a vanilla coke. or it’s because i accidentally stood next to a microwave that one time. or because i made the decision to move in hopes i could give everyone a better life. or because somehow i infected her with HIV. 

I was paranoid for days until my tests came back. but days felt like years. i was going crazy. every time my phone rang every time i heard one tiny sound. 

my test results came back negative. i wrote off that obgyn and all the bad experiences i had with them and i tried to move past it. 

only i cant, i have such bad anxiety and paranoia i cant do anything but get angry and my boyfriend and cry and want to leave, but he wont let me. 

i have the constant feeling that something terrible is going to happen and i have nothing to do but wait, and i have the undying need to care for something, anything. I want my baby back so bad. 

And what hurts the most is while I prayed so hard to God to not be the reason my baby was taken from me, to spare my boyfriends life and health as well as mine I found solace in having a reason my baby was gone. 

But now, blessed me, we were all healthy.. I don’t have a reason she left me. And I don’t know how to move on.

midcenturymadame,"I am very confused as I write this. I have my good days, and then I have some bad. I can get snappy, especially when I don’t feel good. When I get migraines it’s especially bad and hard for me to communicate anyways. I’m confused because I wonder..”am I too sensitive, and take things too personally? Do I misinterpret what my husband says?” He’s very helpful around the house, and helps with cleaning and cooking. That I am all very thankful for. However, the way he talks to me and calls me names makes me feel inferior. Even his way of communicating... is it passive? Indirect? He will talk to me while I am cleaning, and say things like “I’m sure K ( our 5 month old) would appreciate a bath.” He says this while standing there holding her, and looking at me while speaking. I get upset, in those moments, because it’s obvious I am doing something, and I’m like, okay.... I’ll stop everything and give her a bath. Then I’ll get up to go start a bath and when he sees I’m upset he will come back saying I’m a bitch and that he will do it himself.  So, in a similar scenario yesterday, something went down and I’m still trying to maneuver through the frustrations of it all. My husband made dinner, after I told him I still had a migraine. We all ate and the kids made a disaster with food all over the floor so I got down to clean it all up. I was under the table wiping up spaghetti and I hear him say, “I’m sure K would appreciate some food.” I couldn’t keep it in so I snapped back ,”I’m sure she would!” And he got all mad. I explained that it’s upsetting that I’m cleaning up a mess and if he wants the baby to eat he should feed her.” He got so pissed. The other kids were needy too. After calling me a cunt and yelling fuck you guys he slammed the door and went for a smoke. We didn’t really talk all evening and I couldn’t even make eye contact. So I should apologize for snapping? I said sorry last time this kind of thing happened and he never apologizes for the names he calls me, or for the way he reacts. I don’t even want to talk to him. I wonder if he will initiate a conversation or just ignore what happens like what he usually does. If he does say sorry about anything he says “we were both tired.” I’m so tangled in this. Idk.

I never feel that it’s good enough. I feel as though I have to force myself to go through life. And for months I’ve been fighting off the feeling that I should just give up on it. On everything. I’ve tried talking to my husband about the way I feel and he just doesn’t know what to do. I don’t know what steps to take to help myself. There’s so much going on in my life that’s hurting me and dragging me back into what feels like an empty void. And the anxiety is just as bad. My mind keeps coming up with scenarios in which someone I care about or myself could get hurt with every action I take. Or my mind will make me paranoid to what is going on in other people’s minds. And I can’t control it. I have noticed myself taking up nervous habits like rubbing my fingers or my forearm until they are raw. The anxiety has gotten so bad that I can’t drive anymore.

I haven't gotten a night of sleep for months. I'm starting to hate him. I didn't get a chance to see him for 3 days after he was born. All my family got to see him and touch him first. The only time he doesnt cry is when my mom holds him.

I spent my entire pregnancy scrambling and working 16 hour days to be able to buy needed crap for him when he came home. As well as moving twice. First to leave his crap dad and then to a new house with my mom.

All he does is cry and gruggle. I'm still trying to pump since breastfeeding wasn't going well. My output is terrible. All I do is feed him change him  wash bottles and pump just to turn around a d do it all over again. While in the 20 minutes he isn't crying or sleeping I'm trying to clean this pigsty house because my mom is incapable of cleaning after herself and try to study for nursing school so I don't have to be broke af for the rest of my shit life

I'm so done with all this crqp. I want to give him up for adoption but his crap father won't terminate rights so here I am trying to do all this on my own. Giving him to crap dad isn't an option he's a drug addict

zack0404,"So I don’t know exactly where to turn at this point but I have such a crazy story that I hope this is the right forum to post this issue in. I’ll also try relationship advice but I’m I’m desperate right now, and hope that some mothers can help me understand and maybe even help me realize if my situation is wrong or right. 

The story: I’m a 21 year old Male who has been dating a 22 year old woman since she was 4 months pregnant. We were friends for a little before I knew she was pregnant and I figured I could look past it and begin a relationship with her. I stepped into a situation I may not have fully understood. Her Baby’s father is not around so ever since I came around she has looked at me and viewed me and the father. I since have backed down from calling myself the father because I realized it wasn’t healthy for the child for him to think I was his dad. I was there when her son was born around 7 months ago and have been here ever since, but calling me dad was a mistake in my opinion since we aren’t married and I don’t support him financially in anyway. When I was “dad” anything I did was wrong and I felt as though me working hard for them was being taken for granted. I stepped into this situation, but after being here she wasn’t grateful she accepted things from me that I wasn’t able to do. I’m a college student and my mother and father do not really approve of my relationship due to the responsibility of taking care of a child who I did not bring into this world. My gf wanted me to spend the night and be there with them, but I still live at home and me essentially moving out is not an option. I rely heavily on my mom and dad for things as I am unable to work and go to school right now due to reasons I would rather not share to keep my identity hidden. My girlfriend stopped trying in our relationship for about 3 months. We broke up and have been working on things, but she has issues whenever I go out ever since the baby if she isn’t there too. No matter the situation there is a problem with me being out. I never have had an issue when she goes out and never will. She’s been out twice without me to the bar and I had no problem. I’ve only been out less than 6 times with the baby and 1 of them was with her. Every time I go out without her we argue and she says it’s because of her Postpartum and she’s dealing with trying to accept things like that again. We aren’t able to have a mature adult conversation about it and anytime I express my feelings I feel like she isn’t listening and only listens to argue. We have been trying to fix things and this is one of the last issues we have to fix before I think things can get better, but I don’t wanna be in a situation where I can’t even go out without it being some kind of problem. She gets really rude and disrespectful in arguments with me and I’m frustrated and tired. I love this woman as we’ve been through so much, but I don’t know how long I have to wait or if postpartum is just a crutch to act out. Recently she has had a problem with me going back to a place where I attended my first three years of undergrad for a week. I’m not going there to just party. I have a couple things I need to take care of as far as internships go and as far as some volunteer work goes. She has said we’re single (which we are) and that if she goes out and she dances with guys or flirts it’s ok because of my choice to go somewhere she isn’t comfortable with me going alone. I feel like she doesn’t see my side of things and used her having a baby as a crutch to not hear my side and argue. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m losing my voice and don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong. I don’t know how to get across my side without being insensitive to her life changing event. I love her and her son but I also feel I need to look out for me and my feelings, but every time I try I’m not understanding and not helping her get over this postpartum. I just don’t understand and I don’t know how long it is gonna last it’s been 7 months. It’s especially hard bc I stepped into this situation and have no support from my family so I have nobody to get advice from. I hope this makes sense any help is appreciated and any thoughts would help too. Feel free to ask questions if something doesn’t make sense. I want to answer unbiasedly and to understand.

cynthea12,"I was diagnosed with late onset postpartum depression. My son was 6 months old. I experience anger or complete disconnection primarily when it does kick it. 

When I was diagnosed, I told my husband I needed support and action. I'm the decisive one of us, but when my PPD kicks in, I need him to actually DO SOMETHING. 

This morning, I was hanging with my LO, now 8 months. He was in a really good mood. Then, the cat threw up. Four. Times. Well, got to clean that up, right? Now, LO is screaming in my face while I do this. DH is sleeping because he works third shift. LO is screaming his head off, but it has to be done. 

So I've cleaned two spots and tote everything plus LO to the other two while he continues being a complete asshole baby. DH makes his way downstairs and I give him a brief rundown as I clean. He takes LO, I finish and migrate to the kitchen to put everything away and make a bottle. And then repeat everything I already said because my DH can be a friggin idiot and doesn't listen when I talk. 

On top of this, the friggin cat walks in and he's been meow screaming in my face all morning, so I scream at him.

This is going to sound unrelated but I promise it is. In case you couldn't tell I have pretty bad depression and anxiety. 

My mother just finalized her second divorce. All the power to her. He was an abusive pos and I'm glad she's finally out. The shitty thing from this- she is on title of my mortgage with my husband and owes $130 000 in taxes this year because of the payout from her divorce (the total she got was over $1 million but was put into a corporation so she can pay herself as an income). She wanted to sell my house to pay for this. She supposedly had been ""looking into every other possibility and this is the only way!"" She was bought out of the his house with the downpayment for mine. We were all going to move in together- my mom, brother, husband, me, and our kids. We each had our own space since my basement is an in law suite with separate entrance. She decided after 6 months she wanted to get an apartment with her new boyfriend. Okay fine. 

So my kids my husband and I live in the house, my mom and brother move out. She then decides to go to a whole bunch of concerts (3 days out of the country to see various bands. Pretty expensive) and travels to ""get away"" basically every second weekend. So now she owes a ton in taxes because she took out too much and her exhusband put her dividends from his company from 2 years ago so he wouldn't have to pay taxes on it. 

My mom comes to me with this plan of ""we need to sell the house and I need all the money from it"" but I'm a stay at home mom and we literally cannot afford to move. We would end up homeless because we can't rent anything with enough bedrooms in our price range. 

Obviously my husband freaks out, and rightfully so, I was too. So we go to her with several ways to not have to sell the house and eventually we all agree on it. Yay happy ending right? Not exactly.

Because of this apparently irrelevant stress my husband and I basically got wiped out. As soon as he heard she came to me with this selling the house crap he says ""we can't have any more kids. Ever."" We have 3. We planned at least 4 but were willing go up to 6. I'm on birth control and I absolutely agree we need to wait until my mom can be taken off title and paid out or until I have an income (I'm doing home daycare and have 2 kids lined up so far because I can't afford daycare for my kids who are 5, 2, and infant.) He wants to get snipped but i said I'm not ready to close that door. He immediately backed off that BUT has said a few more times we have to be done having kids. 

This was not the plan. I have a very hard time with change. I like things to be worked out and I was so unprepared for this. Even though the thought had crossed my mind too it was still tough to say it and hear it. I feel like everything got messed up because my mom, having the money to pay, doesn't want to pay her income tax. I know I have to talk to my husband about this. It could actually mean divorce for us though and I am terrified of that. I've been crying over this for 3 days and feel completely lost because I know I'm not ready to shut that door. I know I want at least one more baby. 

I look at my infant and cry even more because what if she is my last? I haven't enjoyed it enough and I feel like I messed up by not and I'm just so unprepared for this and I'm scared. I hate this so much. Even though my husband and I have a great relationship and usually talk everything through very thoroughly I'm too scared to come to him with this and have him shut me down. What if I end up resenting him if we don't have more?

ButterflyWriter,"I'm 4 months postpartum and am feeling a little lost. Recently I shared something on Facebook which really really struck a cord with me and put exactly how I was feeling into words. I won't post the entire thing cuz it was pretty long but basically it was saying that nobody prepares you for not having your baby inside you. it says your body after you have a baby feels like a stranger because everything is like different with extra skin, extra marks and saggy boobs and such like that. It really spoke to me because for the last four months people have been asking me how I feel and I've just been saying all I'm fine or I just feel different and nobody could understand what I meant even I didn't know what I meant. So when I read that article I realized it was saying exactly what I was feeling and I felt a little better so I shared it. Well in sharing it one of my husband's Aunts felt the need to comment on it and make a snide remark along the lines of ""I never had to worry about that I just looked at my baby cuz I knew why my body looked the way it did."" I don't know why but this really hurt my feelings because for once I was actually putting my feelings out there in a subtle way and for somebody to just basically make it sound like I was some selfish person who only cared that they didn't look like some tight, toned, skinny little thing anymore it made me feel like shit for even sharing something like that. if this isn't the right place to post as I apologize I just haven't been able to find a community in which I could speak my feelings about being postpartum.

Justsitstilldammit,"I’m a mom of a 2.5 year and 7 month old who I really can not complain about. I have the teaching job I always wanted and loved until this, my 7th year. My husband is amazing and does more than his share of the work that goes into running this household.

Up until this fall, I felt confident and happy, like any challenge I took on was manageable. In fact, I liked being busy!

My son was born in May and my maternity leave lasted until October. It went great and I was lucky to have so much time. Between then and now I feel I’ve become a somewhat different person. I thought I was just handling the stress of a new baby and going back to work a little less gracefully than usual.

Much happened between Oct-Dec, but we all kept telling ourselves to just “make it to winter break!” It was the first day back Tuesday and after school, in the middle of telling my mom a funny story from the day, I started bawling and literally didn’t stop until I fell asleep around 11 PM. That’s when I knew something was wrong and I needed to ask for major help.

In retrospect, there were a LOT of red flags, but again, I just thought it was me not being as efficient. I could go on about the feelings and mood swings and anxiety, but my question is this:

What strategies have worked for you in the interim between starting Zoloft and it being in your system fully? If it takes weeks or months to feel “normal” how do you cope? I certainly have to return to work soon, so what if I panic? What if I’m needed and can’t do it? How do I do my job and care for my family in even the most basic way if I can’t even muster the energy to get dressed sometimes?

I feel like if I had a plan for those difficult moments so I can still function in the meantime until I genuinely feel up to it, it would make this process seem manageable.

Some days I drive my bf to work so that I get out with the baby, since it's hard for me to leave most of the time.

And it was actually great! I was anxious the first half, then I relaxed enough to go shopping at Value Village. I almost bolted out a few times because E was fussy and nursing on and off flashing my nip everywhere, but I didn't. I shopped. For *myself.* Then a random lady gave me a 20% off coupon!

geraltofbeeria,"I posted here months ago when my wife was in the midst of full blown PPD. It was bad, she was diagnosed with serious depression.

Now fast forward 11 months later, I think a lot of the issues have been resolved. Her depression turned to anxiety, but she seems to enjoy life a lot more now than she did a few months ago.

Yet tonight...we were happily watching ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"" with the kiddo. 

In one episode, the somewhat-neurotic character Abe starts going full-blown neurotic, envisioning slights that don't exist. I remarked, ""Oh god, I remember when the kiddo was three or four months, you were a bit like that...so glad that's over.""

I know, stupid. Stupid! 

  
She calmly turned around and remarked, ""You know, I still don't think I had PPD then. Have you considered that I was tired, and I was upset about how you never helped around the house? That I had to yell at you just to get you to do stuff?"" 

I was genuinely a bit stunned by her saying that. Because I -did- help, and as I saw her struggling with PPD, I ramped it up even more.

I didn't want to start an argument, so I said: ""I'm sorry if I didn't help enough in the past. But you know since those days I've been really trying to make sure that I'm pulling more than my weight so you're OK now.""

Her response: ""Yes, I know. But that doesn't address your previous behavior. Maybe one day I'll forget, but I won't forgive it. Ever. And just because you want forgiveness doesn't mean I'm obligated to give it. But anyway, the past is the past...and I want to keep on watching TV.""

And she continued watching TV like that previous conversation didn't just happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh. What do I do? Nothing? I don't think picking at this scab helps anyway, especially when she has her own recollection of what happened during those painful early months. But to some extent I realize that it's this deep-seated anger that puts some shadow in our married life.

I am 7 PP and we are spending a month with our family over the holidays and so I can work from home with childcare help. Anyway, I thought it would be so great to be near family but I am honestly really struggling. I desperately need the break, yet I am also not wanting to share my baby so much. It is usually just me and him during the weekdays (I am finishing up my PhD and work from home while he naps). My mom and mother in law are both super hands on, and I know I should be grateful (and am), but I also feel sometimes like they are taking over. I feel terrible and selfish that I wish my baby would have a little separation anxiety, but he honestly is a really happy baby and seems to have no trouble when I am gone other than when he is hungry. I feel like a milk cow and am questioning how much my baby really feels a special bond with me beyond that. I can’t connect with him or feel close to him as easily as I do when it is just me and him. I just want him back to myself, but I know this is not healthy, as soon he will start growing up and he needs other people in his life too. Also my husband and I have been arguing a lot, and I get super jealous when my husband is playing with the baby...sometimes he walks in the room when I am holding the baby and gives the baby a big smile and talks to him and practically ignores me.

MechanicalEngineEar,"I am pretty sure my wife has PPD after our daughter was born and I assumed it was passing as she is 7 months now and things have gotten better, but I am realizing that some of what I thought was things getting better is me just accepting the new reality.  

My daughter is super easy to care for, even our nanny and friends say she is the easiest baby and we have no idea what a hard baby is like.  She basically doesn’t cry and is always in a good mood, but my wife has struggled terribly and in constantly either lashing out at me or just losing all confidence in herself.  

I was ready for the responsibility of a baby but I can’t deal with being treated the way she is treating me.  She is making my life miserable making up things to fight about constantly and choosing to not fight with her just means she screams at me for not caring.  There is no way to escape.  

I don’t know what is going on.  I have read PPD symptoms and it seemed like she hit every box for the first few months.  It is a little better now but I am thinking there is still something seriously wrong.  Luckily the worst my daughter has been involved was the car seat wouldn’t snap into the base once and she started shaking and jerking it with her in it and I stopped her but it wasn’t so much to hurt her.  

Some days she will literally start every sentence with me by saying “no” first.  She can’t even explain why she does it but she is clearly just dismissing anything I was saying so she can talk. 

Everything is an attack on her apparently and any attempt to help is me saying she is incompetent and any time I don’t offer to help I am being selfish.

A little backstory: I (37/f) had our first baby in June, 4 weeks premature. My mother came out immediately to stay with us and help out, and stayed about 3 weeks. My husband and I live 15 hours away from our families and have no support system in place here. 
My MIL and BIL came out to visit and meet the baby when I was five weeks postpartum. My BIL stayed in a local hotel, but his mother stayed here with us in our 900 sq ft 2 br/1 ba home. They were here 4-5 days, but it was hugely stressful for me to have company, struggle with nursing my premie, etc. I know now that I was also dealing with PPD that was making me edgy and more anxious than usual. Although I was never outwardly rude, apparently I was not terribly hospitable and I made my husbands family feel unwelcome and awkward. 
(It might be worth noting here that she has known me for 15 years, but we have only lived away from them for 2 years, so this was her first time staying in our home).
My husband is a rockstar; he is amazing with our daughter and has been nothing but supportive as I have dealt with my PPD. But I am concerned that this has put him in a difficult place. 
We will be traveling to our families homes for an extended visit over the holidays. Do I owe my MIL an apology for my lack of hospitality? I feel that my mental health is private and not her business (I’m on medication now and doing much better) but at the same time, there’s no excuse for treating people poorly, and I don’t want there to be hurt feelings going forward.

TiberiusBronte,"I have a long history of depression, and have been in and out of therapy since I was a child, and on and off medication for most my adult life. Before we started trying for my first, I had been off wellbutrin for over a year and was in a really good place, but my husband and I were still cautious. Fortunately that pregnancy and postpartum period went really well, and I made it through without relapsing.

Now I have an almost 2 year old, and we are expecting #2 in December. This pregnancy has been so much harder than my first. Severe morning sickness lasted well into my second trimester, and I have been exhausted pretty much the entire time. I am constantly overwhelmed and feeling horrible feelings of fear and regret about this second child. Today both my toddler and me are sick with a cold. I lost my temper and screamed at her once and made her cry, and I feel absolutely awful. (I am normally working full time, so it's unusual for me to be at home all day with her).

I am having thoughts that get increasingly negative as time goes by, that I'm not meant to be a mother, that this new child deserves someone better than me. I recognize these for what they are but can't seem to stop them. Not only that, but I worry that things will only get worse when the baby has been born.

B1gPapas,"29 y/o father to a 10 week old. The first 5ish weeks were great, but about 5-6 weeks ago we had a few bad nights of sleep that sent me into a spiral. I sat in a work training just absolutely miserable, and started having intrusive thoughts about how pointless everything is and then started feeling scared of hurting myself. It progressively got worse in those 4-5 days after, which I knew it was time I got some help so I made an appointment with my primary. He ended up giving me Hydroxizine/Buspar, and referred me to the therapist. I went to see her and we talked it out which certainly helped. She ended up referring me to the psychiatrist and after our discussion he diagnosed me with an adjustment disorder, but  I turned down any further medication because I was feeling better at the time. 

For some context my wife is completely good, so proud of her, but also a little jealous that she's handling this way better than I am. Our baby boy is healthy and happy. I started a new job back in July so there's a bit of stress there, finances are good though. 

Fast forward to today and I'm about as anxious and depressed as I was in the beginning. It's like a complete regression and I'm scared. I don't want to hurt myself and keep telling myself I never would. I'm scared to take anti-depressants, but I want to feel better. I'm going to make another appointment with the therapist and hopefully see the psychiatrist so I can get something to nip this in the butt.

jamesdranko_,"TLDR: SAHM, 2 kids, oblivious working husband. Exhausted, moody, angry, overstimulated and annoyed at every little thing. Scared. 


So I have two little ones, a 2 1/2 year old and a 7 month old. With my first, pregnancy was great, no issues, he was pretty much the perfect baby. Slept thru the night at about 3 months.

Now with my second, breastfeeding was easier, he was just as happy, up until about 3 weeks ago. Getting him to stay asleep in the transition from your chest to crib is like carrying a bomb, he wakes up as soon as you start to lay him down. He also has been waking up every 45 mins at night, I’ve never been so exhausted and helpless in my life. 

I yell at my 2yo almost all day and feel horrible about it. I’m so overstimulated with noise and commotion all day, it literally makes my head rattle. I just want to sleep and I can’t, I’m uncomfortable because of the little bit of baby weight left, hormones are still making my hair fall out. As soon as one kid is down for a nap, the other wakes up or the dogs have to go out, or the laundry or dishes need done. I haven’t had any “me time” in over a year, and haven’t slept well in just as long. 

And getting my SO to understand this is impossible. He’s a great dad, just has zero concept of how badly I need help. I do 100% of the housework and cooking. When he has the kids and they annoy him, he just drops them off at his moms house for the day. 

Just in the last 4/5 years I have gotten out of a toxic situation with my mother and sister, and have learned a lot about myself, my emotional and physical health and have felt great up until this last pregnancy and birth. I feel like I don’t know this person that I am now. I’m lost on what to do. Some days are decent but most days I don’t want to play mom and just want to cry all day. 

I’m at a loss of what to do. Is this PPD? I feel like it’s not that extreme but I also feel like this is never going to get better.

throwaway164578988,"This is going to be long, and I really don't know how to put it into a TL;DR. I'm sorry. 
Also using a throwaway account because I don't want to be ridiculed on my main for what I'm feeling. I've seen it happen to others, and I don't even want to try to be honest on my main. 


I'm 6 weeks postpartum. My baby is growing so well. Shes gaining beautifully and has the typical dirty diapers for the day. She sleeps so well at night because shes swaddled. 

That being said... I hate my life. I hate her. I hate how nothing is easy. 

Breastfeeding has been a real bitch. It's been issue after issue. When she was born, she wouldnt eat so the nurses hounded me like crazy. When she did eat, she tore up my nipples. She had a tongue tie. Got that corrected at 2 weeks, and then she was still having issues. Not staying latched. Constantly fussing because of that. Sucking down tons of air. MARATHON nursing sessions that leave my nippmes raw and flat as pancakes. Visited a lactation consultant and found a lip tie. Our ENT is booked until December. 

Now going on a week, she doesn't nap long during the day. 30 minutes mostly, and hour is I'm lucky. So I literally get nothing done. When I finally start to take a mental break for me, she wakes up. I don't get any break. Shes fussy with everyone else, most of the time, unless it's me. When she is on me, all she wants is the boob. 

It's so frustrating. This isn't at all how I pictured my life going. I had to drop out of college because I knew mentally it wouldnt be okay to finish for this first year of her life. My body is ruined. I'm not okay. And I don't even love my daughter. I hate everything. I look at her and get anxious. I hear any noise she makes and get anxious. I haven't talked to her. I haven't engaged. I feed her and then try to get her off of me asap. 

And my doctor told me that he doesn't believe I'm suffering from PPD since I can still enjoy other things. 

I don't know where this is going, but I figured this would be a safe place to vent. ",Postpartum_Depression,I don't know what's going on,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/9sez7g/i_dont_know_whats_going_on/,1540857913.0,2018-10-29 17:05:13,9.775560042630615e+18

I was told I could be on both Lexapro and Wellbutrin while pregnant, I stayed on only the Lexapro. I am having very bad post partum depression now and need to take Wellbutrin as well. My pediatrician is telling me taking both of these is not a good idea while breast feeding. I’m heart broken now, breast feeding is very imp to me and I’m beating myself up for not researching this earlier.  I am very sad about not being able to breast feed, having my breasts leak and having to wait for them to dry up is very tough.

PPDThrowaway_1992,"My Little One is 8.5 months and I think teething again. While in a happy relationship, I feel like I do 90% of the parenting. I can't get help from him because of his agricultural job requiring him to work  2am-7am and 2pm-7pm five days a week and just 2-7pm one day a week. My mother in law watches our daughter while we work and he picks her up since I work closing shifts at my job. She pretty much goes to bed right when they get home, so all he does is bathe her and put her to bed. I usually get home between 11:30pm-12am and have to pump again when I do. If I want a shower and dinner, I don't get to bed until 1am. My daughter usually wakes up at 1:30 or 2 so I don't even bother going to sleep until after she's woken up and gone back down, usually around 2:30 am. Up again at 5:30 and then awake for the day at 7am, right when hubby gets home. Last night broke me. I didn't have to close for once so I was able to go to bed at 10pm.

AStark89,"Sorry if this post is all over the place.

My daughter (M) was born May 6, 2018. She’s 3 months and 3 days today (not sure if the 3 days actually matter). Since I finding out I was pregnant in October 2017, my mother has literally been driving me insane.  She has been in and out of town constantly, because she doesn’t like the city we’re in, if I had to come up with a rough estimate of how long she’s been in town since October last year, I would guess approximately 4-6 months, and 6 is being pretty generous. She’s always been controlling, even as a kid. It was always “her way or the highway”. As a kid, ya, I can understand that. I’m a kid, not an adult. I’m not yet responsible enough to make tough decisions by myself. If I was a kid, I would need guidance. I am 29 years old at the end of the month. I am perfectly capable of making decisions and taking care of my child. 

My mother wanted to be in the delivery room and literally kick the obgyn out of the room to deliver my daughter. I told her no. When I went into labour, I told her I didn’t want her in the room, but she still threw a hissy fit when my nurse said she couldn’t be in the room (2 people were allowed in the room, not including hospital staff). My boyfriend (daughters father) and my doula were in the room, and that was what I wanted.

When my daughter was finally delivered (I had a very long labour and delivery), we knew how excited my mom was and because she was so upset, we called her first to let her know M had entered the world. She came to the hospital and after my boyfriend and I had both done skin to skin with her, we gave her to my mom to hold her.

Fast forward 2 days later, the doctors had kept me in the hospital, due to an infection, and I was finally discharged with my daughter. Later that evening, my mother had come by to visit and see M in her home. I was trying to breastfeed and where my daughter was literally eating every 2 hours, I was exhausted and my breasts were tender, my nipples were aching. My mom got angry with me because my one side was literally so sore, that the fabric from my bra made it hurt more. I’d decided to breastfeed on the other side to give that side a break. My mother forced me to feed on the sore side, aggressively squeezed my nipple and literally latched M so bad, that there was a bruise, right from the top of my nipple, all the way to the bottom. Then, after SHE got angry and wouldn’t let me do what I needed to do, continued to say, “oooh, it’s okay, you’re doing a great job! Don’t be so hard on yourself!” Obviously, she didn’t understand why I was crying. I refused her help after that.

She never respects mine or my boyfriends wishes. In fact, she ignores it, rolls her eyes and does it anyway. I want to slap her. I’ve told her about it time and time again. I’ve tried the nice approach, I’ve tried the angry approach. I’m almost at the physical approach now. That’s not good.

I’ve asked my mom to babysit 3 times in total. She wants me to ask her to babysit more, but I don’t think she would even be reliable. My boyfriend hasn’t been impressed either, where she’s making fun of the way we’ve decided to raise our child and goes behind our backs to do what she wants. I can’t trust he. I had an appointment the other day and had brought my daughter over to her house before my appointment and told my mom and her roommate, (who, by the way, wants M to call her gammy. Like, wtf, no!) that M had a really bad diaper rash, so make sure they put the diaper cream and corn starch on her bottom to help it heal. Her roommate goes on to tell me that babies don’t get diaper rash in disposable diapers, so she MUST be allergic to it (she’s starting showing symptoms of teething so I’ve been assuming it’s that) and continued to argue with me about it. I didn’t have time to argue and left for my appointment. After my appointment, my mother had M cuddling with her, and M’s pants and bib off. Fine. Her bum was changed and they’d fed her. Perfect. First thing my mothers roommate says, “we don’t like the bibs you use. You need to stop using them.” I said, “excuse me?” And she said, “well, they ride up and cover her mouth!” And I say, “oh, is that right??” Well, I guess if you’re going to babysit then you’re going to actually babysit, aren’t you? Or are you lazy and can’t pull it away from her mouth? She wears them for spit up and her drool.” Her roommate goes, “what??! She’s teething already?? She can’t be, she’s only 3 months!!” And I said, “well, I’ve looked it up and that’s what it says”. “Oh, okay. Let me show you something........ Look at these pictures of my grandkids, aren’t they great?!” I say, “yes, they’re very beautiful pictures.” Moms roommate, “Good, because yours suck so we were thinking maybe you should get them redone!” “EXCUSE ME??! You may not like our pictures, but we do. I don’t give a shit what you think of my pictures, but feel free to take yourself off of the mailing list.” I start getting my daughter dressed and talking to her while I’m putting her in her car seat, and she smiles at me. A big one, one of the ones that lights up her face. My mom says, “hey! How come she never smiled for me?!” And pretty much pushes me out of the way. I then say, “ well, I have to go. Talk to you later.” 

The following day, a close friend came to my house to babysit my daughter. We were planning on hanging out that day anyway so it worked out. My mom calls me twice during my appointment. I text her saying that I’m in an appointment and I’ll call her back after. She goes oh, me and your dad are leaving for the farm today and we wanted to drop some stuff off for you. Okay, I said, my friend is watching M, I’ll let her know you’re coming and you can drop it off. Fast forward 30 minutes later. I’m home. My mother had just gotten there 10 seconds before me. She’d turned onto my street just before I did. I park my vehicle. “Hey,” my mom says, “ how come you didn’t get me and my roommate to watch M. We were both really upset.” I said, “ya, well, I’m under enough pressure as it is without your roommate telling me off because she can’t keep her goddamn mouth shut.” My mother says, “ oh well, you can’t take what my roommate says seriously.” I say, “actually, I don’t have to listen to what she says because she’s not my family. I don’t want her babysitting my daughter if it’s going to be about how shitty of a mother I am.”

mamabear9143,"Nobody warned me that I wouldn't feel good enough for you. After years of crying for you, envying every one of my friends who sported a big belly, sorting through baby clothes and feeling the wiggle of life inside of them. Nobody warned me that there would be a day that I resented you and your fussiness, your cries of pain from a gas bubble that you couldn't get out. They always tell you that the epidural hurts, breathe through your contractions, that for 6 weeks you won't be able to feel that closeness with your partner again, maybe even longer. They say that your body will ache and you will be swollen, your belly will be deflated and your self confidence may take a nosedive when you finally find the nerve to look at yourself naked in the mirror for the first time. But nobody warned me that there would come a day that I hated myself for being so selfish and wanting you here. One day I would walk out of my door and cry while you cried in your swing, after I've tried everything I could to calm you and I would tell myself that I am too stupid for this. How am I going to raise a child when I have so much hate for myself. How can I cuddle you when every time we touch I cry because I know that if someone else were to do the things I do for you, you would be fine. I feel like my only purpose in life is to feed you, burp you, change you, bathe you. I don't even feed myself anymore, what's the point? You are so tiny and so precious, I feel like I'm spending what could be our happiest moments wishing I could just disappear. Nobody warned me it would be this way. Nobody offered a shoulder or an ear if I needed it. I didn't know I would need it. I've been depressed before, but nobody warned me that I would cry every time I fed you, that I would get aggravated when I'm changing your diaper and you won't be still, that when I feed you and lay you back down and you scream bloody murder and there's nothing I can do but listen to you scream and cry until I can't breathe. You don't deserve this. You deserve a loving and patient mom, not someone like me. Nobody warned me that the intrusive thoughts would be too much. That I would think in detail how I would off myself every night while I'm laying in bed. Nobody warned me that suddenly I could relate to all of the new moms who fell victim to suicide.

smj711,"I’ve been feeling better for the last two-ish months and not having to pull myself out of this deep dark hole I’d fall into regularly, but I honestly feel dense for not putting two and two together before, especially since my daughter is 16 months old already.

I had my daughter two states away from my family and stayed there, alone with her, until she was two months old for maternity leave and health insurance reasons. Going through a pregnancy alone and then being 100% alone with a baby for the first few months as a new mom is not something I’d recommend to anyone. Thinking about the sleep deprivation alone at that period gives me anxiety just mentally going back there.

I attributed all of my symptoms to being a single parent and told myself I just needed to “try harder” get over it; PPD never even occurred to me. The anxiety, severe depression, suicidal ideation of me and her, extreme fatigue and exhaustion, isolation, etc., I could go on and on, never connected in my brain as possibly even being PPD.

I moved back home for “emergency support,” which I absolutely do have here from family, but I definitely don’t have “emotional support” or anyone looking out for my personally. I love my family, but they’re not warm and fuzzy people.

I haven’t been back to work full time since before she was born—-worked for about six months remotely after maternity leave, worked for less than a month after that full time before getting laid off, went on unemployment for six months, working remotely part time again now. I’m hoping getting back to work when she’s 18ish months old will curb a lot of the depression and will be better for both her and me.

My sweet babe entered the world this past Sunday. He is absolutely perfect in every way. 

I had a really rough labor. But baby and I are both healthy and mom is well...moms gonna be recovering for awhile.

I’ve been worried about PPD most of my pregnancy, I always thought I’d be a prime candidate for it and-yes it’s still early so I am trying to take it Day by day. I know the hormones are flying everywhere right now so I’m trying to take that into consideration also.

Our first night in the hospital I missed my LO. (He was sleeping in his bassinet right next to me) but I snuggled his blanket and cried.

Our first day home was exciting and terrifying and I cried at least 10times. We just moved, our house is a disaster, but we have more than we need so I keep trying to count my blessings.

My husband is a saint. He is the most loving, supportive, caring man. &amp; he has done more for me than I can say -he actually suggested I find a group on here. 

The littlest things make me cry. I cried because now that he’s three days old he doesn’t look like he did when I first had him.

I cried because I wanted to be able to see my son when he sleeps and also see my husband at the same time.

I cried because I am so uncomfortable and wish I could just sit/stand/lay normally and be able to do more things with baby then just feed.

I cried because I can’t shower by myself and I walk like a sumo wrestler after each bathroom cost.

I would gladly do it all again to bring this perfect little angel baby here. But I wish people talked more about how HARD both physically and moreso mentally labor/birth/and motherhood is. I feel like I was in no way prepared for the emotional aspect that I’m currently living with. I have an amazing support system and I’m so so grateful that I do.

But I honestly just want to keep my little family just to myself. I don’t really want anyone to visit, I don’t want anyone else to hold him. &amp; I know everyone is excited too.

What do you feel are the biggest barriers to seeking care for mental illness treatment during the postpartum period??

fijuka,"Hi everyone, I'll try and write a really short version of what's going on: My boyfriend of 8 years has been having depressions for years, slowly fighting his way out of them. He has gotten a lot better, doesn't have trouble getting up in the morning anymore, going to work, he stopped smoking \(cigarettes and mariahuana\) and finally figured out what to do with his life, which is to study computer science and become a programmer. He also went to a therapist for 6 months but stopped, because he felt that it didn't help him anymore like in the beginning. I got pregnant \(unexpected\) and he said he didn't want a child now that he finally knew what to do with his life and when he wanted to start new studies. I, however, really wanted the child and assured him he could still do his studies as planned.. after a few days, we decided to have the baby, because he said he thinks it will be the solution that will make us both happier in the long run. During pregnancy, however, he had monthly breakdowns where he said he didn't really want any of this, that he was only doing it for me and that he regretted the decision. \(He also had these sort of breakdowns before, by the way.. just evenings where he suddenly started saying really heavy things like he doesn't really want to live etc.\). This was all really hard for me but I kept hoping that it would pass once the baby was here. Since the baby came \(he is now 8 months\), he has had these breakdowns once every 2\-3 months. In the beginning saying he hated his life now, that everything had changed, he missed alone time with me and he doesn't want all this responsibility and to make time for a baby in his busy schedule and that he regretted the decision. In\-between those breakdowns, he said that he didn't regret it at all, he is happy that we have our son, that he loves him a lot and is really sweet with him most of the time. A few weeks ago he even said that something had really changed now, that he was beginning to feel a bond to the baby and that it brings him joy to spend time with his son. Now on Sunday another breakdown. He didn't say he regretted having him but that he felt overpowered by everything, that it's too much and that he wants to spend his time doing other things than taking care of a baby \(it should be mentioned that I do pretty much everything, he sometimes spends 2 hours with him or watches him in the evening when he's sleeping anyway, the only thing he does almost every day is change him before bedtime and read a short book to him\). I don't know what to do anymore. When I ask him after these breakdowns he says it's a good sign how rarely these breakdowns happen now and that I should trust what I see most of the time: that he loves him and likes spending time with him. That he's not really himself when he gets in a mood like that.. I however am full of fear after these breakdowns, fear of the next one and mainly fear that my child will grow up hearing stuff like that, once he understands what his father is saying.. this thought is too much to bear for me, that my son will grow up having to listen to shit every few months, hearing that he wasn't wanted. On the other hand, it's good that he talks about it openly and it might be normal to have these feelings, especially if it's a form of PPD.. am I over\-dramatizing everything? Should I be happy that he's happy most of the time and believe that?

unknown_stuff,"I don't know how to help, and I need advice from those who have gone before me...

Background: I love my wife, and we have 2 wonderful children.  She is a stay-at-home mom to our 6 month old girl and 2.5 year old boy.  Both of them are absolutely wonderful, which she continues to express on a regular basis, and I agree with.  She is a stay-at-home mom by choice.  She has always wanted to be one, and leaped at the opportunity to leave work once my job was stable enough to provide for all of us.  Last night, my wife wrote me a note telling me that she wants to kill herself.  Everything she has described as being the problem is nearly word-for-word a description of postpartum depression, but this isn't the first time she has struggled with depression.

My wife has experienced depression in various forms since as long as I can remember.  For the most part, she continuously expresses that it's manageable.  If you were to ask her, she just has ""swings"" where sometimes she feels absolutely horrible and has nothing but terrible thoughts.  These swings stick around for a few days, and then ""go away."" She claims vehemently that her feelings never should have existed and she doesn't understand why she felt that way in the first place.  Every time this happens, she explains that it was silly for her to feel that way, and every time, the feelings come back.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it either.  We've tracked these ""swings"" together with her input, and they don't match to any cycle or pattern of events in our lives, they just... happen.  It has always bothered me, but to be honest, I have never known how to help much more than I already have.  I try to always be there for her and be supportive throughout these swings, but I don't know what else to do.  We have discussed professional help on several occasions, and I almost got her to agree to it during one of the more recent swings, but by the time we could call and schedule a meeting, she refused to do so because she was no longer feeling that way.  Cue the talk about how silly it was for her to ever feel that way and she is fine... it's quite obvious she isn't fine, but I don't know what I can do.

Right now I work 8-10 hours per day at work, and I am building a business by night.  When I am home, and the children are awake, I go into maximum dad mode.  I always wake up earlier than her on the weekends so I can get up with the children and let her sleep in, and I make sure I spend at least an hour a day with our children and put my son down to sleep each night so she doesn't have to worry about that.  This leaves us with about a half-hour to an hour per night that I can talk with my wife and eat dinner, but I feel like I'm tapped out time-wise.  Without her wanting to go to professional help, what can I even do?  Even if she does go to professional help, what are we going to do with the children?  With a 3 year old and a 6 month old, how can she go get help for an hour without us having to hire a babysitter and being dependent on their schedule?

I have tried different methods over the years as my wife has expressed issues with various things.  When the housework was overwhelming, I offered to hire a maid.  The maid came for 2 weeks and my wife dismissed her because she didn't want the added expense...  When child responsibilities were too much, we put our son in half-day daycare.  She barely made it on time to drop him off, and usually slept through the entire 4 hours he was gone.  Then, she would get angry that she had wasted her time while he was at daycare, and eventually pulled him out because she couldn't stand that we were ""spending money on something stupid when she should just suck it up"".  I mean, how do you help someone who thinks this way?

There appear to be a number of issues that come up, but every time she asks for help and I try to provide what she asks for, she ends up shutting it down out of guilt.  Now, with this note about her wanting to kill herself, I am very seriously concerned.  I can't keep doing this and pretending anymore.  She needs help that I cannot provide, and I am afraid that any suggestion in this direction is going to be entirely shut down on her end.  She has expressed that she feels like she isn't in control of her own life anymore, and that she cannot deal with the chaos any longer.  She just wants everything to end.  She has expressed feelings along these lines in the past, and I interpreted them as ""she needs a well-deserved break"", so I did things like planned an entire weekend away with the children so she could be by herself, or scheduled a night out for the two of us or just her where I watched the kids or we got a babysitter.  These things help, for a time, but she always goes back to feeling this way.  It is obvious now, with what is essentially her suicide note, that what I am doing just isn't enough.

QUESTION:  How would you deal with this?  How CAN I deal with this?  Is there anyone with advice for me? :(

Edit: Additional note - she is always ANGRY.  Even on days when she is feeling ""great"" she has this constant rage bubbling under the surface and it explodes out every time something sets her off.  This is a common symptom of PPD that people feel due to lack of control or understanding, but what does it mean when it's constant?  She had rage issues before our children were born and I don't know if that's necessarily something that comes along with non-postpartum depression.  I feel like I am in so far over my head... I genuinely care for her, and I don't like picking apart her mental state to try and ""fix it"", but I don't even see other options.",Postpartum_Depression,Please Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/88zr5p/please_help/,1522704920.0,2018-04-02 14:35:20,2.477869474238732e+18

I had my first baby 6 months ago. I've definitely had ups and downs since then. But I can't shake the feeling that my marriage to my husband has changed. And I'm not quite sure in what way. But I don't care to be affectionate anymore other than hugs. Kissing, even lightly, seems foreign to me and just doesn't feel right. And being intimate is practically nonexistent and that's all my fault too. We've only had sex once within the past 7 months. I feel like the connection between me and my husband has been broken and I don't know what broke it or why and how to get it back. We weren't perfect before I gave birth but we were happy. We don't talk much anymore except through texts while we're at work, and our work schedules don't permit much time off together. But even when we're off we don't actually spend much time together. We're either just in the same room existing or I'm watching TV taking care of the baby and he's on his computer. It's hard to even find activities to do together with or without the baby because we don't have a ton of things we share in common to do. We run errands and that's about it. 

I don't know how to feel and I don't know what to do about it. Was it birth that changed my hormones and changed how I feel? What do I even feel? Is this something that can be fixed?

-salisbury-,"Very new &amp; needing help! My first child is 5 months old and I have recently been diagnosed with postpartum depression. I’m shocked by this information but my husband (a doctor) seems to be under the impression that it was obvious. (He told me that he thought I knew.) We always agreed to two kids.  Since my daughters birth my husband has been more and more excited for number two. He loves parenthood and can’t wait to do it again. I have become more and more sure that I never ever want to do this again. Each day older seems like a step closer to my freedom. I’m painfully aware that another baby puts me back to square one. I love my daughter and she’s worth this to become a parent, but I am a parent now and I don’t feel any need to do it over. 

My question: for those who had ppd with previous pregnancies, did it make you not want to have more kids? Once the ppd was resolved did you change your mind? I don’t know if this is ppd or me realising that I don’t want any more kids... if it’s the latter I need to figure out how to proceed with my husband who feels the complete opposite. Prior to this diagnosis I was sure that I just didn’t want more kids. Now I’m not sure. Thank you!

GorkTheDestroyer,"A bit of backstory. 

I'm a 20 year old single mother who lives with her Dad, Step Mother and 9 out of my 11 siblings. 

The baby and I share a small room that holds barely enough to be considered ""our space"". 

When I found out I was pregnant I lived with my mom and was in the process of moving out with a friend. My Dad stepped in and was like ""hey come here, we won't charge rent etc etc."" so I moved here instead.  

I have a history of depression, self harm, and I have borderline personality disorder. 

I enrolled in a medical Assisting program to feel less like a worthless pos.  The post partum depression really started to kick in early January and at my sons 2 month check up I brought up that I was feeling depressed. 

My doctor puts me on Zoloft and after 4 weeks of it my life just feels like absolute shit. 

I lost my transportation because my engine seized, I have a negative bank balance because I decided to debt myself with school. I'm failing school because my son keeps me up all night and then during the day I'm so unmotivated and depressed I just lay in bed or sleep and don't do my schoolwork. And then at school I feel so overwhelmed I spend 2 hours or so out of the 4 hours I'm there crying in the bathroom because I feel like such a failure. 

I'm a heavy smoker and because I'm broke was forced to quit smoking and when I get angry I get violent and my self harm tendencies want to come out so I find myself punching walls and throwing stuff because what I usually use to calm down is cigarettes and I DO NOT want to break my 2 years of no self harming. 

I live in a shoebox of a room that is overflowing with baby stuff and my stuff and some days I want to just say f it to my things and throw them all away because I don't matter and it would just clear up room. 

My doctor just started me on Celexa today so I'm hoping in the next few weeks it will get better because the Zoloft just made everything worse. 

I just want to grab my baby and run away from all of my problems. Because this house and these people here make me feel like I'm drowning. 

I have no one to talk to.  My dad thinks mental illness isn't actually real and that you're weak if you have one. My step mom (despite her schooling (psychology) ) is the most insensitive person I've ever met and just tells you to suck it up. I hate my bio mom so she's out of the question.  And I'm on my dads insurance and the last time I was in therapy he got wasted and drunkenly called my therapist and harassed him. 

It just makes me angry that I was doing so well before I came here. My father is a toxic man and I thought because he works mainly out of town this house wouldn't be so bad. But then he comes home and I stay locked in my room with the baby because I'm scared to be in the same room as him out of fear that he will talk to me because he's always drinking and it always escalates into something. 

Some days I get so mad at myself for being in this situation and putting my son in a position where he could be influenced by my awful father. Sometimes I wish I would have never gotten pregnant because life would be so much easier and I could have done it right. School, marriage, then a baby.

ClarkandIndy,"I’ve reached out to my husband about how I’ve been feeling and he doesn’t seem to grasp the idea or look deeper into how I may be feeling. It’s daunting and dark and the thought of reaching out further is scary and exhausting.. I wish for a hand or a hug that pulls me up on my feet. Everyday is a new one and I try and tell myself this but on top of every positive thought sits gravity on top; as if I’m the horse stuck in the mud in the never ending story. The harder I throw my arms about, the deeper I sink and the darker my surroundings become. Incredibly emo (which makes me even more embarrassed by my emotions) but sadly accurate to how it feels when no one ‘believes’ you. I feel as though he would like to be supportive but is more wishing it would just go away and I’d be normal again. 

I can’t explain the guilt I have; I’ve read that this is a common feeling accompanied with ppd but I sometimes find myself apologetic to any person who spends more than 5 minutes in my space. Is this normal? 

I tried opening up to my mother gently on the subject (almost in passing) and she starts every sentence with ‘sweetheart’ and denies I’m in any pain and this is what everyone feels, making me feel more within myself and doubtful or almost embarrassed to admit anything. I’d like to bury the hatchet and try to get on with things and tell myself I’m being silly but every article I’ve read says this is unhealthy or not the right way to move forward. Not sure what other choice I have though considering the reaction I’ve been getting.

mathwiz87,"I just want to have a good day that isn’t pretend. I put up a brave face for everyone everyday. I’m a Middle School teacher and this week I’ve had 3 students come to me with suicidal thoughts and 2 self harm incidents. Another student I love was attacked by a dog on the way home and a drunk man tried to grab her. Another student, who just returned from the hospital for suicidal thoughts, is saying he doesn’t want to be here and he may not be here tomorrow. All of these students are in one class period. We are a small family and they all call me mom and I call them my babies. Dealing with PPD myself, I do my best to be a good role model and show them my strategies for getting through the day. 

Last week I had a panic attack in this class. The kids swooped in, hugged me and sat me down, found me another teacher to help calm me, and then got the rest of the class started on the day’s assignment. 

It made me feel good (4 days later when I reflected on it), to see that my babies had taken my advice and used it to help me. I loved how they have progressed through their issues enough to be helpful to someone in their shoes. 

Maybe one day we’ll all get through this darkness. We see the light. We just can’t reach it, YET. ",Postpartum_Depression,"Short story: I can’t get through my tunnel.

TheNerdyNursery,"I want to talk about something dark and scary that us moms don’t talk about enough: I want to talk about postpartum mental illness. 

Last month, I was committed to the psychiatric ward of my local hospital due to self harm and suicidal ideations related to severe postpartum depression and anxiety triggered by a traumatic pregnancy and having a preemie. 

I’d gotten into an argument with my sister in the morning (i don’t even remember over what) and then a full blown fight with my husband when he got home from work. We’d almost never screamed at each other before (best friend’s for 15 years), and he stormed out of the house with our 5 month old after elbowing me out of the way, leaving a bruise on my arm and chin. 

I felt worthless. As a best friend, as a wife, and as a mom. I sat staring at a full bottle of Xanax (prescribed to me for PPA and insomnia), thinking how easy it’d be for that dose to kill a 120lb female. I genuinely felt that my husband and son would be better off without me. 

Thankfully, instead of swallowing a bottle of Xanax and washing it down with whiskey, I called my dad and said i needed help. He took me to the behavioral crisis center at that hospital, and because i was admittedly suicidal, I was admitted. 

I ended up staying for 5 days and it was hell. However, it kept me from hurting myself and did give me some new coping skills. One of which was art. I’ve always enjoyed painting, sewing, and sculpting, but I’d never learned to use it as a therapeutic escape. It helped a lot more than the meds did (don’t worry- I’m still taking all of them as prescribed). 

As it happens, I’m at that age where it seems like all my friends are also having babies. So now I have an excuse to do a variety of art projects to keep me busy (I’m a stay at home mom) as well as create some more positive pregnancy-related feelings). 

Pregnancy and postpartum is not all about “the glow” and cute baby bump and planning names and nurseries- it’s HARD and between hormonal rollercoasters, a changing body, and a changing relationship with your spouse (not to mention working out the new financial strains, maternity leave, annoying relatives, and a million other things) it can really and truly suck. If you’re expecting or a new mom, pleas know you’re NOT alone in feeling depressed, enraged, apathetic, anxious...these are all signs of postpartum depression and/or anxiety. It’s TREATABLE, both with medication, therapy (one on one or group), and some behavioral and environmental modifications. Getting better is possible. 

The problem is, we’re made to feel like “this is the best time of your life!” and “you should be so happy” and “your baby is healthy; what more could you want?” and “you just need some sleep.” No one wants to talk about the darker sides of pregnancy and postpartum so we’re left feeling overwhelmed, alone, ungrateful, and confused. 

Please know you’re not alone. Please know you’re not a bitch or a bad mom for any negative feelings you’re having or thoughts that pop into your head. It’s a chemical imbalance playing cruel tricks on you, and it CAN be helped. All you have to do is ask. 

If you need a starting point, my inbox is always open. Postpartum.net is also a great resource to find PP therapists and groups. And of course, talk to your OB.

Kathy578,"So I have been discharged for 8 weeks from the hospital for PPD. I still feel like a mental mess, but I am progressing each week. I did quit my stressful job un-regretfully and DD is still in daycare.

My rejection of DD has nearly passed. I can care for her without getting angry with her. I don't blame her anymore for my condition. Some days she is too much so MIL happily takes her for the night.

MIL is still the same with her ""advice"" but I don't let it get me down or feel like a bad mother. I once told her that her ""advice"" was hogwash. She apparently asked her church friends and they agreed with me.

Shamefully, I didn't pick up my prescription and let it run out. After a week, I became tearful and perpetually sad. I have also been mad at DH. DH picked up my prescriptions on Friday and I am waiting for them to kick in again. TIL how important medication is for PPD!

With no job and DD at daycare, I have been ultra cleaning and purging our home. I feel a boost of pride to have such a clean home. I have also been trying my hand at hobbies like sewing, knitting, and basket weaving. Such activities has been helpful with my anxiety.

DH is really trying to step in. He has taken a more active role in caring for our daughter. I still blame him for his role in my PPD, but I am trying to forgive him. I am angry that he passes on our DD to his mom when I am unable to care for her, but I am realizing that he is just as overwhelmed as I was (doing it alone) and he is asking for help (like I was too guilty to do). He has been very supportive about quiting my job and leaving DD in daycare to help with my recovery. I am very grateful to him.

So it has been a roller coaster of emotions and recovery, but I am healing and moving on.",Postpartum_Depression,8 weeks after hospitalization,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/7hgkgj/8_weeks_after_hospitalization/,1512409437.0,2017-12-04 10:43:57,1.089637797883412e+18

Kathy578,"I was on here nearly three weeks ago asking if I should admit myself to the hospital. Well, after I sent it, I realized that if I'm asking then I should go. Within the hour, my MIL had our DD and DH was with me in the ER. I was in the mental health ward for 11 nights.

I'm glad I did it. I was put on medication and forced to stop breast pumping. I realize now that I had become obsessive with breast pumping despite the affect to my health both in body and mind. 

I met other patients that talked with me to make me feel better and I felt gratified to do the same. I met one lady that was suicidal due to the death of her DH of many decades. She showed me the scar on her wrist from her attempt when she was a young mother suffering PPD. I met bipolar, schizophrenic, suicidal, addicts, split personalities, and healthy people that just said the wrong thing that got them admitted. I am very grateful to many of them for being kind to me. I learned very quickly they were not judgmental and took care of each other.

I was homesick and ecstatic to be going home to my family when I was discharged. Very quickly, I realized that I was angry with my baby and got anxious too easily. I had never blamed my baby or had no wish to care for her until after my stay in the hospital. Before, I always took it upon myself to lovingly care for her because I should as her mother. In my guilt, I smashed a teacup on the wall. It was the first time I was violent and normally I can talk myself out of destroying stuff. Needless to say, DH packed up all the china.

I'm still not myself and still trying to recover. I have some bad moments, but each days seems better. I am on indefinite medical leave as of now. DD still goes to daycare and my MIL for the night.

SalvyComplete21,"Recently I've given birth and she is almost 2 months now. Since giving birth, my whole life has changed. I think what I find most upsetting is my husbands life really hasn't changed. I've gained the baby weight (10lbs), I get up in that middle of the night to take care of her, I do most feedings and diaper changes. He really hasn't made any life changes or sacrifices. He hasn't needed to change or watch his diet, didn't need to go to multiple doctor appointments, or stay at home for 3 months while he sees her for 4-6 hours on weekdays. 
I can't help but envy my husband and his life. He never had to carry a baby therefore didn't need to change anything about his lifestyle (alcoholic drinks and certain foods), his hormones are not out of control, he gets to go back to work without worry about baby and able to socialize, his family lives in town, and his friends are excited and eager to see her. I on the other hand are at home all the time with our baby while she continues to yell and cry and sleep. I feel trapped but have to take care of her. I am an introvert but I usually socialize at work. But without work I have no social life. My social life has been reduced to ""how was your day?"" and ""what would you like me to make for dinner?"" I am not against any stay-at-home moms, and pretty to them, but honestly mom life is just not for me. I work in a trauma medical field, I need that thinking skills on the spot. I feel like I'm treating her as one of my patients versus as my child. That makes me feel terrible because I am lacking that feeling of wanting or needing to love her or even give her the love that she deserves. I keep reading on how or what to do for Mom's her age, realizing I honestly feel it doing that.
To top it off I honestly feel like I'm raising her alone. My husband comes home and maybe sees her for 5 hours a day. I have to tell him to hang out with her or to do things with her. Even on the weekend I feel like I'm still the main parent who takes care of her. I haven't gone back to work yet but I honestly feel like he will not realize how hard it is to be a solo parent most of the time until I do go back to work. I have also realized our lack of intimacy and sexuality. I do not know the reason as to why there's a lack of intimacy. Maybe he is just not interested or terrified that he might hurt me.
My family lives out of state and his family lives about 30 minutes away. His siblings are either extremely busy or super selfish with they're own lives. I can't blame them, we were selfish as well before a baby. His father pretends to vomit at the sound of a fart or fowl smell therefore can't/won't watch her and his mother still works full time. I basically have just him and her in my life right now. Some days it's a miracle if I can even get a shower in. I had many co-workers that were looking forward to me having a child and them coming to visit to realize that no one that I work with has yet to do so. They have all made plans but something is always came up to cancel it. Honestly makes me wonder I'm actually liked at work or if it's just summer time and it's a busy time for everybody.
I have an appointment with my doctor soon to talk about these issues. It is to see that if they are actually issues or if I'm having postmenopausal issues. There are times when I reflect on my thoughts thinking that they are legitimate things that I should bring up but other times I think I'm just being a selfish new mother. But most the time I just don't know what to think. I just knew that she deserves to have a happy and good and healthy mom and I hope if I'm not that that I can be that soon or one day.
So I'm mainly just looking for conversation or just understanding. Maybe I need a stranger to tell me that I'm being super selfish or for them to tell me that I'm having some postpartum issues. All I can tell you is that I really enjoyed my life before I was pregnant. And now I feel like I'm in jail.",Postpartum_Depression,Depressed or Selfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/6ont3w/depressed_or_selfish/,1500667899.0,2017-07-21 13:11:39,1.675489739770598e+18

notsotoothless,"TW: Discussion of rape

I was in a 2 year relationship with a man I almost married who, among a plethora of other abuses, raped me repeatedly. Thank Christ I never got pregnant when we were together, but since then I have been paranoid about becoming pregnant when I wasn't ready and take a test about once a month for reassurance. 

With my DH, I was finally ready to have a child but was still fearful of what pregnancy and childbirth would do to me given past experiences. I was fortunate to be what my nurses called ""medically boring"" and except for some concerns about dehydration had a very smooth pregnancy and delivery. Didn't stop me getting PPD.

After I finally accepting what my ex really did to me, I got angry. So incredibly angry. Then along came PPD, and I got even more angry. I was so overcome by rage a couple of weeks ago that I was throwing things, broke a couple of (incidental) items in the kitchen and literally could not speak. Once, during pregnancy, I got so outraged about something my cat broke that I screamed for a full 30 minutes until I lost my voice.

I have always been prone to depression and specifically depression that manifests as anger. I remember as a child that I hated my brothers. I mean, I fucking **despised** them. Until finally something broke in me and I didn't have the strength to carry that kind of rage anymore so I just shut down for several years before I started self-harming and then finally circled around to a somewhat healthy mental state. (During my self-harm phase, I actually did reach out to a therapist who told me he thought I was ""just a very serious person"" and there was nothing wrong with me. Since then, I've been soured on the idea of therapy considering the amount of time and effort it would probably take to find a decent therapist and the fact that it would all be out of pocket cost.) I feel like the abuse I went through combined with my PPD are going to set off the cycle all over again. I don't want that. I don't want to put myself or my DH through it, and I don't want my daughter to remember her childhood that way. 

We have less that $50 in our account after bills. Even if I were willing to pursue therapy, I can't afford it. I don't want to go down this path again, but I don't know how to stop it.

drccmflb,"Is it possible to get postpartum depression before delivering?

I'm 25 weeks today.

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was scared but ecstatic. For awhile I was really happy, really blissful, just enjoying everything about it.

But for the past week all those feelings have dissipated. I'm not interested in doing anything but laying in bed and browsing websites on my phone. I have a hard time convincing myself to shower or eat. I feel like my identity has been ripped away from me and I have no sense of self anymore; often I just feel like an ambulatory womb.

Last night I cried for hours just wishing I would have got an abortion. Wishing my birth control didnt fail me, wishing I didn't have HG, wishing I could just be me again - working and doing my makeup and everything else I used to. 

My partner convinced me to talk to him and he thinks I'm going through postpartum depression, but I dont see how as I haven't actually given birth yet.

I dont want to feel this way. I love her and at the same time I dont. I feel like I've failed her and failed myself. I'm worried that when she comes I will be a terrible mother, but at the same time I am horrified at the idea of being a mother at all. It's such a strange mix of emotions.

Is it possible to be going through PPD already? Should I tell my OB/GYN about this or see a therapist?

clb0128,"Today I'm three weeks postpartum. Last night I broke down and confided in my husband about my depression. The problem is I've been depressed for over a year and a half. I struggle to show him that I'm happy in our marriage, that I love him, that I appreciate him.

I dated a guy who struggled with severe depression. I have walked in on him holding a gun to his head or lying in a puddle of his own blood because he had cut himself. And I never understood when I was with him how someone could want so badly to die. But now I get it. I'm honestly tired of living the way that I am. Knowing that I'm only living because I don't want to hurt my husband (and now my beautiful daughter). The thing is I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to think that dying would make things better. I don't want to be depressed. I'm tired of living for other people and not for myself. 

I love my daughter, she's the most precious thing I have ever seen. She's the best thing I've ever done. But it's hard to be happy right now. It's hard to be okay when at 130 in the morning I'm sitting alone in my living room on the couch pumping and massaging my sore and engorged breasts. Massaging- hah that makes it almost sound pleasant. Let's be clear about one thing: it's not pleasant. It is painful. 

I've cried more times than I'd like to count tonight. I've cried because of physical pain, I've cried because my baby was crying and wouldn't stop, I've cried because the intrusive thoughts about harming myself scare me, I've cried because my husband and I are fighting, I've cried because when we had company earlier I could barely put on the ""I'm okay"" mask, I've cried because I'm hormonal, I've cried for no apparent reason. But mostly it's been because I'm not okay. And even though I know postpartum depression is a very real thing, I feel like everyone still expects me to be okay. Last night we had company. They very generously brought us dinner, they wanted to check in on us and baby. They both asked me at least twice how things were going. Through gritted teeth I simply said ""they're going"" even though I wanted to say that things sucked, that I'm not okay, that I'm crying constantly and I feel like crap physically, that I'm exhausted, that I'm stressed, that I'm overwhelmed. But instead I said that I was fine and turned my face away so they couldn't see the tears beginning to well up in my eyes because I'm not okay and why should I be? My whole world is upside down. Not necessarily in a bad way, but it's not normal. I'm dealing with a million things I've never dealt with before. I'm stressed to the max and I'm overwhelmed. I worry that I'm doing everything wrong.

Just when I was enjoying my life, and terminating our wedding plans, I went to the clinic and they gave me the ""you're pregnant"" news and my whole world went down. I felt so confused. I was almost done with my career, almost married, but then that happened. Why did I go on with it? Because of my overly religious family. 
And now I'm stuck in a life I did not want and although I love her very much, I am not happy with my life. Every day is a living hell. I struggle to go back to my old life. I used to exercise everyday, go out to the mall, enjoy being alone and now I spend my time behind four walls glued to a 3 month old. I've never felt so lonely in my life, so empty, no useless to society. I used to enjoy working all the time and now I can't. My mom tries to take care of her so I can work but she's almost always at church with her church group.

Shyabusedmomma,"okay im 21 and a mother to my beloved 18 month old baby. When my daughter was first born everything was okay, well it wasn't perfect. My baby only had a bassinet and wouldn't sleep in it, and I punch and kick in my sleep. i was afraid of co-sleeping in a bed and ended up sleeping with my baby in the living room in a chair. I also lived with my family that are noisy and no sympathy. and i got so tired and i couldn't sleep cause i was expected to clean the whole house so when the baby would sleep i would try to move her and clean if she didn't wake up. and im so ashamed but sometimes i would put my daughter in her bassinet and she would cry and id scream into a pillow or just cry with her. i usually would end up walk into another room and taking another breath. about 3 months later i started to get suicidal thoughts again and i had panic attacks. and I sat down with my parents and begged then for help and they said i was faking it and was just wanting attention and that pills wont help me. ( i have since taken me and my daughter out of that home for several reasons) but i have problems still (cant afford a therapist). i get mad at my daughter and yell at her (like ""go to sleep,and no!) and i smack her hand when she gets into things that shes not supposed to. what scares me is sometimes i go blank when she cries at night (cause she doesn't want to sleep) and a couple of times i have covered her mouth when she screams and i feel like crap about it. like when she smiles, or gives me a kiss, or says mama, or even is minding her own business i feel like im a terrible mother and that i dont deserve her. i've considered suicide several times and the only reason i dont do it is cause im a single mom and my daughter's biological father is a danger to her, and i dont want my abusive family to raise her.... i dont know if i have postpartum that has been dragged out or its just depression... i hate how i get mad and it makes me more mad and i just end up frustrated and stressed out. help please...",Postpartum_Depression,Single mom with issues,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/68y8cn/single_mom_with_issues/,1493811007.0,2017-05-03 04:30:07,1.5847819599348345e+19
casidaisy,"27 yo female with an 11 month old daughter and a 5 yo step-daughter. 

I've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. After my daughter was born it got worse. I would cry all the time, freak out, go into panic cleaning mode...her cries were like razor blades in my ears. I never got the motherly instinct to comfort her, I just wanted to scream and yell at her to stop. I still feel like that 11 months later; I have no patience and my fuse is so short it's almost nonexistent. 

I should also add that aside from my partner's mom and dad, I have no one here for me. His ex wife has told me I can talk to her, but I know that makes him uncomfortable. His best friend's wife, and another of his best friends has told me I can talk to her, too, by I have social anxiety that has developed over the years and I always end up being super awkward and saying weird, vague shit. His parents are great, but they travel a lot to visit his siblings in other parts of the country so I don't have a reliable person to call on when I need help.

I talked to my doctor a couple months in and was prescribed Sertraline, a generic Zoloft. I don't feel that it's helping at all. I don't get to go to any counseling or talk therapy because we work opposite schedules and I never have time during normal business hours. I just feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place and I don't know how to get out of it. I rarely sleep, I almost never eat, and when I do it's absolute shit. 

Something else I deal with is my SO's inability to understand what I'm going through. When I am struggling or when I tell him what's wrong, I'm met with crappy reactions or him talking to me like I'm a child. I know he wants to help me, but in the moment his reactions make me feel worse. Example: today baby hasn't slept all day. She didn't sleep all night, either. I work until 2:30 am, so I've been awake for a loooooooong time. Baby screamed her head off for the better part of two hours and all I kept wanting to do was tape her mouth shut and put her outside. I would never hurt my baby, but the thoughts in my head scare the shit out of me. His response: ""you can't say that stuff while I'm at work helpless, wondering what may or may not happen to my infant daughter.""

He speaks like I'm a babysitter and I abuse babies. This is someone with whom I share my life, someone who knows me...and yet I get backhanded comments about me harming our child. I understand that can happen with PPD, but that response really messed with me. 

I just don't know what to do. I know a lot of people struggle with PPD and PPA, but I still feel so alone.

Sassybru10,"I have dealt with depression and anxiety my entire adult life. I got off my meds when we were thinking of having children. 
Had my first child with no real issues, the birth the was text book, a little baby blues but then I was fine. The second one came along a little more than 1 year later and that birth was anything but normal. Technically everything went ok but it was traumatic for me and I'm not quite sure I ever got over it. It's been a little over a year now and I'm in full blown depression and anxiety hell. I was crying daily and losing it at every little thing. I finally went to the Dr a few weeks ago and got back on my meds after being off them for 5 years.

I went too long thinking I could get better on my own but now that I'm actually being proactive, trying to have a better attitude...he's not. His attitude has a huge effect on me and one wrong side-eye or comment throws me back down and I feel like I'm starting all over, pretty much daily. How do I overcome his attitude to better my own so in return his will get better?

I'm suicidal. I'm safe. I'm not going to hurt myself. I know I have things to live for, but that doesn't stop me from feeling suicidal. Even on my best days, a suicidal thought pops in my head. I don't want to be this way, I just am. I can be driving down the road perfectly fine and an intrusive thought pops in my head and I think 'I could just crash my car right here and it would be over.' 

I'm so excited about this little bundle of joy coming in June, but I know that PPD is very real possibility and very likely. Do those of you suffering with PPD or who have suffered from PPD have any tips?

t89cm,"I am at a loss. My wife and I have a 6 mo girl that has had some feeding and GI issues. The pregnancy, birth and postpartum hasn't been what she had hoped or expected. She is a stay-at-home mom. I am the bread winner and I own part of a family business. I do maintain a good work life balance.

I started to see issues arise right after the baby was born. It was as if I was not adequate in her eyes, I couldn't do anything right. 

Since I do work in a family business and I manage a few people, my leave was sometime interrupted for a few minutes with questions or quick troubleshooting of issues remotely. She immediately took issue with this and started a campaign against my family.

There is a lot of blaming going on directed solely at me. I'm passive in the sense that I really don't dish anything back. I know there is a problem and I don't want to make it worse.

I am at the point that we have been to marriage counseling, and all the counselor covered in a few sessions was better communications and didn't want to touch any PPD issues. I have been going to counseling for myself more as a validation that I am doing things Ok. The goal my counselor says is to get her back to therapy but she sees no problem with anything she has said or done.

Sillybutter,"I first realized I was depressed when I was pregnant. During a very planned and happy pregnancy I was miserable and could not understand what value I would have as a human and how dare I decide to become a mother. I dismissed my friends and doctors who pointed out my depression. I made excuses for the way I was feeling and played at off as just being upset over the changes I had to face. Yet I would stand in the shower and say terrible things to myself and I was convinced I was useless and awful. 
After a two day labor and traumatic emergency c-section I went on to have full depression. I couldn't cook. Clean. Dress myself or smile. I was dead inside. I would do exaggerated fake smiles Timmy child. I could not speak to him or sing or do anything that was considered motherly. I did breastfeed but in all honesty I did it because it was the only thing that I could do. The only thing that I somehow hadn't been able to prove to myself that I was a failure at. I nursed for two years and that was it. My saving grace. 
I come from a very toxic family who spews such hateful mantras it would make you vomit. It was refreshing that at least when they would pick on my while I nursed, saying that I didn't have enough milk, that I could pull my breast from my nursling and squirt a dozen streams of milk several feet in their direction. Each time they would chuckle and move on to the next thing. But at least I could nurse. 
Writing this has me in tears although it's been a couple years. 
I held on to the one thing I knew I could do and over time added one or two things back to my list. I was not a failure. I was not a nobody. I was not hated. I was not scum. 
I had planned my life very carefully, married a sweetheart, we made very good money, lived in a very nice place, I was done with school and had my dream job. We planned this child and the moment that test said positive my world in my mind had entered a twilight zone. I was this person who was trapped in a fog of self hate and could not find a way out. 
No one could help me. But the people closest to me, mother, grandmother, husband even, friends, actually made it worse by constantly pointing out my flaws and digging at my insecurities. Some meant no harm but all in all I can see how bullies can affect an already depressed person. 
It's been almost a full year that I have felt like my old self. But even so, I seem to wonder if I have always been somewhat depressed. If I have ever been happy. Have I always had depression and then it was exacerbated by my pregnancy? 

I need to know. Because I can't go through it again. I can't become pregnant again if there's a risk I could disappear. And for how long next time? My mind was so terribly cruel to me.

ElsieG,"I have been struggling with postnatal depression for five months now, I am not even sure if you could call it 'postnatal' anymore. I have struggled with depression in the past, but it doesn't compare to what I feel now. When my baby was six weeks old I was submitted to a psychiatric hospital, obviously everyone had high hopes for my recovery, but the truth was that I still felt horrible. 

I am still ridden with anxiety on a daily basis, I cry every single day, I don't enjoy anything and the worse is, I feel no bond with my baby. I think about suicide constantly and have even planned it in my head, I have researched painless ways to commit suicide but I just don't have the guts to actually do it, although I have overdosed myself on my anti-depressant and sleeping pills (nothing happened obviously). 

My medication have been changed numerous times, and we still have not found the right medication (is there even a thing like 'the right medication'?) I guess I should just go on suffering each day, because at this stage I can't see the light. I wish I could be the mother my baby deserves, I wish I could be happy again, if not for me then for my baby. She deserves a mother that can laugh, have fun and enjoys life.",Postpartum_Depression,I can't cope with my postnatal depression anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/53gwey/i_cant_cope_with_my_postnatal_depression_anymore/,1474305792.0,2016-09-19 10:23:12,9.461210985617658e+18
aconsidine89,"I am a member of the NICU club (as my son's nurses told me to help me cope). After a high risk pregnancy due to polyhydramnios and 2 days of being induced, my son arrived seemingly healthy. 8 hours later, after the joyful tears and visitors, I woke suddenly to my husband holding our son and screaming, ""Breathe! Please breathe!"" My son was choking on excess amniotic fluid and I slept through it. He was turning blue and I SLEPT THROUGHT IT. Had my husband not been there, had he stepped out for a cup of coffee or a phone call, my son would be gone and it would have been my fault. I think this is where the dark battle downhill began. I went home without my baby. My worst possible nightmare came true. I cannot describe the feeling I had walking out of the hospital that day, leaving my newborn with strangers, hooked up to machines and IVs. That's when it got worse. We slept in the NICU every night, only going home to shower and eat. A week later, we brought him home and I thought the feeling would go away, but it didn't. 

I felt overwhelming guilt for everything imaginable. Still guilty that I slept through my son choking for air, guilty that we were due to move across country soon (husband is military) and away from my amazing parents, guilty that I have to be a working mom and knew I couldn't stay home forever, guilty that I didn't hold my son enough, guilty that I didn't exactly love breastfeeding, guilty for everything. Then the anxiety crept in. I didn't leave the house alone because in my mind, everyone wanted to steal my child or run me over with their car in the parking lot of Target, or that he would catch some awful illness. I stared at him as he slept and stayed awake for days on end because I was petrified he would stop breathing. Then the OCD began. I needed a bulb suction in every corner of the house - just in case he choked again, cleaning bottles and practically burning my skin off because the water had to be scalding or they weren't clean, meticulously counting diaper changes and minutes I nursed. It didn't help that every doctor appointment, including my son's pediatrician, gave me the post partum depression survey - which I constantly failed. 

Finally my son's pediatrician basically said, ""Your son deserves a happy mom - you need to get help."" They put me on a low dose of Zoloft, but after weeks of taking it, I still felt worse. I tried a PPD meeting, only to feel worse when another woman spent 35 minutes sharing how ""meds are terrible when nursing so I refused and instead I do cross fit because getting my body back cured my PPD""....as I sat across from her feeling fat, makeup running from the tears of a panic attack in the car, and thinking about how awful I felt taking Zoloft while nursing. 

It's been 6 months since my son was born. I stopped taking the Zoloft after 5 months. I think my family thinks I'm fine. My friends never knew that I didn't invite them over while I was on maternity leave because of the crippling PPD. I don't really talk to anyone about it because I feel hopeless. I battled anxiety and depression since age 11 and therapists never helped. Medication helped a lot before, but this is different. I don't ever think of hurting my son, and I don't really think of hurting myself, but I just feel like I'm worthless and my son deserves more, like I'll never be the mom I so desperately want to be. My husband and I argue more now than ever, I feel myself pull away from him as he pushes me away. Every single day I feel like I'm holding my breath just hoping he lives another day, that I don't royally fuck up and let him die. One day, one minute, one second at a time gasping for air and praying I don't find him dead in his crib or he gets kidnapped..horrifyingly dark thoughts. I love my son, and he is so amazing. I want to not feel this way but I am so miserably hopeless about getting better.

MommaLeo,"Hello, I'm new to this subreddit and PPD. Since my son was born, 3 weeks ago, I've been really down. I can't stop crying and feeling overwhelmed. Then...when I feel overwhelmed, I get mad and upset with myself because I feel like a terrible mother for feeling that way. When he cries, I feel like I'm having a panic attack and can't handle it.

I have the absolute best husband and support from him. He helps me at night, takes him when I feel overwhelmed, and generally just wants me happy again. The sad part is that I've been such a jerk to him, unintentionally, because I've been so upset. 

Now I know that I haven't gotten much sleep. With my son being only 3 weeks old, sleep is rare. I went to see a doctor today about it and she told me that they classify anything up until 6 weeks ""Baby Blues"". Now my question is...would I feel that way with baby blues? Or is it something more? She had me take a questionnaire that has to do with PPD, and said I scored well above a 10. I'm just so confused and I don't know what to do. 

She suggested a counselor, which I'm going to try to find one that works with my insurance tomorrow. She also recommended medication if I was interested.

TokiTover,"I had this happen to me 8 months ago when I had my baby girl. It was an odd and scary thing to experience. 

For me, I never said a word. Not to my mom or my partner. The only way I got help was from a questionnaire I filled out at the doctors office because I got severely ill.

I told the piece of paper how I was feeling. How sad is that?

From there, I got rooted over to my OB for the psych evaluation. It was not bad but I was done. The only thing that was prescribed to me was sleep.

What?! Yes, sleep. I was extremely sleep deprived. 

But what mom isn't? 

I was to sleep for 4 days straight. No baby, no pumping... nothing. My mom and friend had to take shifts to feed my little one. I was to report to my OB how I was feeling daily. Also I was on the brink of crazy dehydration. Drink water mommies!

After all was said and done, that ""feeling"" went away. I found support reading other womens stories and just talking about it. When reading other stories, it helps to facilitate your healing and your family.

I was also able to be honored to write monthly for Postpartum Support International blog. I have sent over 2 already. When they are posted, I'll will post here for you to view.

This is no joke. It was like a light switch that turned on and I wanted nothing to do with motherhood. Guilt was huge too.

outerbutton,"   I had my daughter by c-section last month. The best way to describe my bond with her is that I feel like i'm babysitting someone else's kids but I know they're never coming back for her. My husband can't be with us so I spent most of the time in the hospital alone and i'm raising her as a single parent until he gets back. She gets up about ever 2-4 hours at night so i'm exhausted during the day. 
   At night when she won't stop crying i get terrible thoughts. like i want to get in the car and drive away without her. I want to shake her but it goes beyond that thought I think about what her body would look like while i shook or what her neck would look like before it snapped. i feel horrible admitting it but now I think about it in the day time when I get to my wits end.
   My doctor upped my prescription of anti depressant a couple days ago and said this is normal of new moms to get thoughts like this and I was right to put her down and walk away for a few minutes.
   I don't hate her but i don't feel like a mom or she came from me. I constantly have to double check my scar to make it seem real. I do like her more compared to other peoples babies (i LOVE babies) 
   I feel awful for having these thoughts and i never act upon them but is this normal do other people have thoughts like this. My doctor suggested I find a message board and talk to other moms but i searched and can't find any body feeling the same way i do. Is it just me?

handee_sandees,"Hi guys, I'm honestly kind of at a loss here. Our first daughter was born 8 months ago. She is absolutely incredible, has always been an extremely good baby, slept through the night beginning at around 10 weeks, always bubbly and happy. She really is a fantastic baby, really couldn't have asked for much more.

But for some reason I think a lot of happiness and emotion I feel around her is forced. I'm a fairly angry person, always have been impatient, easily frustrated, unable to cope with minor annoyances. I get it from my father, who is the exact same way, and I've always tried to hide that from my daughter and show her happiness and love. But it's very difficult for me. I love her, I do, but when she cries for no reason, refuses to eat her food, wakes up at 3 AM, have to leave work early to pick her up, pack things for her just to go on a simple family trip, I see her as a burden, an annoyance. I don't want to see her like that, not at all! I want to just look at her and feel happy, but I don't.

I also haven't been the best husband around my wife. We are different people, I'm a little OCD and like to have a clean house while she is more of a ""I'll get to it later"" kind of person. I love her dearly, but some things she does has just really set me off. It's stupid things, like leaving clothes or shoes in the middle of the floor, or just kind of leaving things done for later. It's stupid things, but it has resulted in fights nearly every single day for the past few months because I just can't let it go. I want to, but it just builds up and builds up inside of my head until I explode. I was never like this before. Yes, I had some anger issues, but those episodes were very infrequent and only over serious matters (not playing that off at all, just describing how behavior has changed). Now my anger and impatience has increased to a level I can't even describe and it is affecting my marriage.

I also can't sleep. On top of the normal lack of sleep from having a baby, I wake up at random hours of the night, or I just can't fall asleep, just because so many things are going through my head. I'm constantly worrying about something or trying to think of what else needs to be done, what I need to do tomorrow, what I need to do this weekend, how will I find time to do this or that. It's frustrating.

We also have no family around. The closest family is 2 hours away, so it is difficult to just drop off the baby for a night and just get away. She is always around. Sometimes I stay at work later or just leave her at daycare for an extra hour so I can enjoy a workout at home or just a minute to sit in silence. What is wrong with me?

Thank you for hearing me out. I would love to hear if there are any other dads who have experienced the same thing or wives whose husbands have followed this general behavior. Any suggestions would be helpful, because I want to change, but I don't know how or what to do.

EFIW1560,"I'm really struggling with my random crying. I'm just emotionally exhausted, and when my baby cries I sometimes get overwhelmed and just can't stop the tears.  

Also wondering if anyone else has experienced some things I am going through. 
I have no appetite. Even when I feel hungry, nothing sounds good to eat. It all repulses me. 
Also when I breastfeed her, t makes me nauseous too. Like, emotionally nauseous if that makes sense. 
Also, the whole sleep when the baby sleeps advice just doesn't make sense. I mean, sure after nights when she is fussy or keeps me up all night, and I need to catch up on sleep, but like last night, she slept for 2 to 3 hour stretches and hubby and I took turns feeding her so we only had to wake up 3 to 4 times during the night.

massenburger,"So my wife just had our 3rd baby (baby girl, very healthy!), and is having something that seems a little disconcerting to me. She really wanted to give birth all natural, with no epidural. She made it into the 3rd stage of labor (I think that's what it's called, where the contractions are over a minute long, right before pushing?), before she couldn't take it any more and asked for an epidural.

After the birth, she's told me that whenever she recalls the birth, she's remembering it like a nightmare, like the pain of the birth is literally scaring her. She's told me she definitely doesn't want any more kids almost solely because of the memory of the pain. This didn't happen with either of our first two. What's concerning to me is just how intense this is for her, it's almost like a mini PTSD episode from what I can tell (and I know nothing about PTSD, so I could be way wrong about that); her eyes get bigger, and her mood immediately changes whenever she talks about it. Now, I know that every mom claims that childbirth pains are the worst, but this seems a bit excessive to me, and I'm wondering if it's something we should be concerned with and possibly see someone about.

However, I'm suspecting that I may be experiencing some kind of ppd. Specifically in regards to intrusive thoughts.

graymal-kin,"Hi guys. If this post is rambling it's because I'm on mobile and dealing with a spot of anxiety. Just want to get a few things off my chest.


At 18 I was diagnosed as having major depression. I would get on a medication, end up feeling like a ""zombie,"" and then quitting it. I would cope with my symptoms but the depression always got the best of me. I, over the course of the past three or four years have transferred schools 3 times, haphazardly quit classes, extracurricular commitments, and jobs, all because I couldn't handle the pressure of, well, anything.

Then I got pregnant. I kind of willed the pregnancy into my life. I was training to be a doula the summer just prior to my conceiving Arya, and I desperately wanted to understand fertility on a deep, intimate level. I kind of made it implicitly clear to my boyfriend that I WANTED A BABY. But this year has depressed me beyond anything I've ever felt.

I love my baby so much. And yet I can barely take care of myself anymore. Friends have to pry me out of my house. I have to force myself into the shower. Like, my brain has been overtaken by mommy-bots. All I can think of is what Arya wants, Arya needs. And I'm glad. I don't have intrusive thoughts like other mothers with PPD, so I'm grateful. I am though extremely paranoid that she will fall almost always.

Sorry if none of this made sense. I see my psychiatrist on April 3rd (he's busy... NYC based momma... We love our shrinks... LOL).

giigglesRmine,"I’m 4 months postpartum today. I love my son more than anything or anyone I have ever loved. Around a month ago I quit my job to stay at home full time. Since baby won’t take a bottle and the separation anxiety kept me from enjoying my work like I used to. I was so happy to finally be able to stay home but then, my partner is always working and I’m home alone all day with baby. We have fun together I love reading, singing, napping, and playing together. But I miss being around other adults. But I don’t have any friends where I live, my mom is close by but I don’t like bugging her all the time. I want time with other adults, I want time with my partner, and I want time for myself. I thought being home would allow this but I feel like I’m standing still with the baby while everyone around us is moving moving moving. And I’m just watching. Then we’re having trouble with the neighbors and are going to end up moving soon because of them. I don’t want to move. I barely want to brush my teeth or eat or even watch tv. I don’t want to move. My partner got me an iPad after months of asking and talking about one so that I could start working on my art again, and possibly writing again. I finally have it and I have absolutely no motivation or inspiration. I was abused as a child and coped with things by disassociating and self harm, as a teenager I self medicated. When I got pregnant the self medication stopped. With pregnancy all the old traumas were somehow revived and I had to deal with that. And birth brought it’s own problems, it was like hello! You have unlocked new traumas! Enjoy postpartum anxiety and depression, you can’t really do anything about it because you’re going to be so enveloped in taking care of a newborn. And then only 2 months postpartum I returned to work. And my heart broke and hey, new shit to deal with. Each stage brings new trials. And with each one I find myself disassociating more and more. I know I should talk to someone, I have a referral from the hospital. But after all this time I just want this to be gone. How long do I have to fight this battle.

I have always had depression, but at least before the pregnancy I knew who I was and where I stood. Now I just feel blank, empty and floating. I love my little cachèton, I love motherhood.

We moved this week and our plumbing is FUCKED so I have yet to take a shower. 

My wife is making JUST enough to cover our bills. We only eat if we can get to the food bank.

I'm a full-time college student and this week is finals

My dog keeps EATING THE GODDAMN FORMULA and I'm too tired to remember to put it up every time

I don't have my ss card so I can't apply for assistance with anything and I don't have ANY money to get one

I had to take the $20 from my savings to put toward high-calorie foods because I was only eating one small meal a day

I missed my therapy appt and she doesn't have openings until Thursday

My MIL needed me to supervise parenting time with her kid and I was 5 min late so she yelled and threw her phone (she's under a lot of stress so it's understandable) but it sent me into a HEAVY PTSD episode.

During parenting time we got into a discussion of first memories and I uncovered a VERY traumatic experience from when I was 3

My wife got called into work so instead of having a nice night like we planned I yet again am alone

I'm starting to feel like a single parent and there's nothing I can do about it. All of my friends are either too busy with school, live too far away, or don't have transportation.

I still have NO CLUE how to do this final paper for my intro to logic and critical thinking class and the professor is already 2 weeks late getting me into a group for the group project aspect so the highest grade I can even get is a 50% at this point. 

I'm having to force myself not to throw up my anxiety med because I had to take it without water while forcing back an anxiety attack because of another driver

I just need a goddamn nap, some goddamn non-processed, homecooked food, and a shower. And to not listen to the bee movie for the 4th time TODAY, the 12th time this week.

k9nan,"Hello all, 
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Sorry for any grammar errors or misspelling in advance.... 

My wife had our son almost 7 weeks ago. Before this week it was all rainbows and butterflies. We were all on cloud nine with minimum amount of sleep, just going through the motions of raising our beautiful son. I have a 7 year old daughter from my first marriage. She lives with us full time as I have sole custody of her and her bio mom has zero visitation rights or any contact for that matter. A couple nights ago our daughter triggered my wife by saying she hurt my wife’s feelings because she isn’t her real mom. My daughter calls my wife her mom and loves and adores her like she is.... however after all said and done She meant that she isn’t her real mom but wishes she gave birth to her. Well long story short this comment triggered my wife into a very aggressive manner that’s been going on for a couple of days. She is now wanting to separate our family and move back home (we live thousands of miles away from our home of record). She is also saying she feels trapped because of me defending our 7 year old. The situation escalated and made a turn for the worst that is still going on. 

I am not sure if this is PFD as I have never witnessed or gone through anything like that. And if it is signs of PFD what can I do to help her. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Again thanks in advance.",Postpartum_Depression,Husband needing advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/n3tdas/husband_needing_advice/,1620065218.0,2021-05-03 11:06:58,9.512787188256133e+18

matcha_milfshake,"Hi everyone! I’m here to get some advice and perspective on what my husband is going through. I am currently 32 weeks pregnant with our first child, and he has been struggling immensely with antepartum depression and anxiety. He has individual counseling and we are also doing marriage counseling.

While it was planned, we got pregnant very quickly, considering I have fertility issues. He had a bad childhood, and thinks he will be an awful father just like his own. He thinks he will be financially irresponsible like his parents. He also just got medically discharged from the military, and the wonderful, well-paying job he had lined up has been delayed for several months. We moved back in with my parents in our home state.

While he is getting help (and thankfully is very willing to talk about his feelings), I feel like I’m at my own breaking point. I’m angry at him, even though I don’t want to be. I wake him up every morning, almost pulling him out of bed. I literally have to force him to change his underwear daily like he’s a child. He won’t clean anything unless I instruct him to do so. He starts twiddling and getting anxious when I ask him about baby gear, birth education, etc. He struggles to go places on his own without me with him. He worries about money constantly, but is too depressed and anxious to sit down and do a job search. He’s constantly complaining and ruminating about how bad everything is. What hurts most of all is that he will not have sex with me. Ever since my bump popped at 20 weeks, he says all he sees when he looks at me is the incoming responsibility of parenthood. Since I have gained a lot of weight during pregnancy (and have had a past history of anorexia) this hurts me immensely. He’s loved me from a size 4 to a size 10, but now that I’ve got the babu bump, he won’t touch me.

He’s usually my HERO, guys. I’M usually the one with mental health issues (anxiety and anorexia) that he has to console. And he’s damn amazing at it. Hell, he’s still amazing at it. But I am having the hardest time being patient with his pain. I selfishly want my husband back. Do any of you have words of wisdom? Or can you help me understand his feelings?",Postpartum_Depression,Husband has antepartum depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/n511kl/husband_has_antepartum_depression/,1620194855.0,2021-05-04 23:07:35,1.4709724699509117e+19
Miserable_Bug_16,"So a couple of weeks back I reached out to you all for some advice with my trans wife and me wanting another child before she transitioned. You all delivered and, well, I wanted to give you all an update.

my wife just called me after a couple of weeks of thinking and she knows that she wants to have another child too. she agrees with me that there are a lot of obstacles and then not having a child would have just been easier but she also knows that that's been the source of my anger and depression lately. 

so the next step we're thinking is to try and get a more stable house, fix the plumbing and kitchen. then it's get my nexplanon out and start trying again. 

I'm all at once excited and terrified. I'm excited to get to have another kid, but I'm terrified of what people will think. I'm already looked down upon for being such a young mom and I think that people might think that I'm a terrible mother for having another child when my mental health hasn't been great. but I'm working on it I'm on a med that's helping my depression another Med that's helping my anxiety. yes I know I'll have to stop my medication if I get pregnant because this medication is bad for the baby but I feel like I'm on the right track.

FewPaleontologist565,"The following takes place in May of 2014

I was diagnosed with postpartum depression with my DD, she was 4 months old at the time. I had just gotten my own place with my EH and DD. I thought that moving out of MIL’s &amp; SIL’s 2 bedroom apartment would stop the stress and harassment that they caused me but I was wrong. These individuals kept hounding me and stressing me out. I was struggling as a new mom and had very little support from EH. He always sided with MIL and SIL even when they were wrong. 

All three knew something was off so they pressured me to go to therapy when I wasn’t ready, that didn’t work out well at all. When things didn’t get better they demanded I go to a doctor and take Zoloft. When I started taking the zoloft I became worse. My EH demanded I constantly take care of the baby while he slept, so I was sleep deprived, stressed out from being a mom with ppd, and his family’s constant insistence that I was like him and suffered from bipolar disorder because I had unresolved trauma from my abusive parents…

Eventually due to all the stress and the Zoloft just not working along with a rather terrible therapist, I snapped and developed postpartum psychosis from it all. Instead of letting me sleep and helping me feel better, MIL and EH decided that the best thing for me was to go to a psych ward.

This was the wrong thing to do. Little fact, I have a major phobia of psych wards and anything regarding anything psychiatric regarding myself. Anyways, I remember when my MIL and EH were driving me there. I sat in the backseat next to my daughter and I didn’t want to go. I just needed to sleep and get off the Zoloft that I didn’t even want to take in the first place! I kept telling them I didn’t want to go but they didn’t stop the car, they didn’t take me home, they just kept driving there to the hospital.

When we got there I refused to get out, and while EH was out of the car, my MIL told me “either you go in willingly or I’ll make security drag you in.” This terrified me and I didn’t want my daughter to witness that as well as being concerned for my own safety against the security staff. I got out of the car reluctantly and we walked in. 

While we waited I kept saying how I didn’t want this, I kept voicing it, and when it was time to sign the papers I remember asking my mother in law if that is what she wanted, and she said yes so I signed the papers and they hauled me away.

I felt so ashamed and humiliated. They did the typical intake process and what made me extremely uncomfortable was being asked to remove all of my clothing. This made me so ashamed of my body and humiliated, as a rape survivor this was horrifying to me. They watched me as I got undressed and watched me as I dressed in these awful scrubs. I still hate the color of green and blue to this day because of the scrubs. 

When I got up to the ward, I saw the locked doors and panicked. I started to cry. I didn’t belong there, I needed to be at home with my daughter taking care of her. When I entered the ward I refused my medications and would do so throughout my stay. I was watched as I used a bathroom toilet, as I showered, I was never left alone and I felt humiliated. I had no sense of privacy at all, I wanted to see the doctor and get out that night. I was never really told the reason I was admitted. 

I begged to have my breast pump there because I was breastfeeding and becoming engorged. They denied me my pump due to safety concerns and gave me a shitty hand pump. It didn’t work the way I needed to, I remember sitting down on my bathroom in the ward and crying as my pump didn't work. My breastfeeding bond with my daughter was gone along with any closeness I felt towards my daughter. 

I kept begging to see the doctor and the nurse said “if you continue to push to see the doctor, you might be forced to stay longer” So they tried to get me to eat the next three days, I hardly ate at all. They gave us food but no utensils. I was so angry at my EH and MIL and I let them know that. I called and told them exactly how they betrayed me and my MIL gaslight the heck out of me. Denying my trauma and feelings.

I was so exhausted because I was terrified that I could never leave. I thought I’d never see my DD again. It was horribly depressing. They slapped a bullshit diagnosis of Bipolar type 2 disorder on me (which has been rejected by my current therapist), and started me on 300mg of Trileptal 2x a day. A prescription that my current GP was appalled that I was given as that is something he would never have given me at all even in that situation. 

Things at home weren’t easy, my DD was diagnosed as “failure to thrive” when I was breastfeeding her and supplementing with formula. I felt like a failure because I was following her doctor’s orders to the letter. When I spoke with the therapist at the ward, I told him of my situation with my DD and how I felt like a failure. This therapist, without even contacting my DD’s pediatricin, decided it would be appropriate to call CPS on me.

I called my EH to let him know what was going to happen, and the police showed up at my home. They ransacked it and told my EH that a caseworker would be by. That caseworker never came by… I was so hurt and betrayed that I sunk further into depression. I wanted out of there. After 3 days I was released and walked out to a bus stop with tickets to get home. I didn’t tell anyone I had gotten out. Not until I needed my  EH to pick me up from the bus stop I was dropped off at. 

Surprise Surprise, not only were EH and DD there but guess who was driving, MIL… I told her I just wanted to go home and be with DD, but no, my MIL insisted we go fill my trileptal prescription. So we went to Walmart and filled it. I was so spaced out but full of rage, I was close to needing to take a trileptal again but I decided not to. After we filled it out and got home, I wanted to be left alone and told my MIL to leave so I could be with my daughter. She refused to leave my home, she told me she needed to see me take the medication and I told her no. I told her the medication wasn’t for me, and she refused to leave me alone and wouldn’t stop talking to me. So I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. She still wouldn’t leave me alone so I went to the bedroom and called 911. 

They sent over two police officers, one spoke to my EH and MIL while the other spoke with me directly. He said that since my EH was on the lease, and that he wanted his mom there, she didn’t have to leave. 

The police left and shortly after my MIL left as well… The next two days were awful. My MIL and EH had decided, even before I got out of the ward, that the next two days that EH worked, I was not to be left alone. The first night my EH’s work friend’s wife watched my DD, against my will, while EH was at work. The second night my MIL watched DD, also once again against my will. For two days I was alone at night without my DD. The time I was separated from my DD destroyed my relationship with her. She was 4 months old then and is currently 7 years old now, I’ve never had a close relationship with her since all of this happened. 

As for my EH and I, we never truly recovered from that. I saw it as the ultimate betrayal, I asked him how he could do that to me, he said he was scared and let his mother take over the whole situation… We eventually divorced after having another child but in all reality the moment I stopped loving him and started hating him was the night I was admitted. 

I constantly tried to confront my MIL about how she betrayed my trust and my feelings but she constantly denied me my feelings and my trauma. She literally told me how no trust was broken. I’ve never hated her more.

Since all this, it took me 6 years to finally go to therapy with a wonderful therapist who has helped me process all this information, she agrees that I didn’t need to be in there and that MIL is very controlling. My GP did not agree with the trileptal at all being prescribed especially on a one time meeting. He and my therapist agree that I was gaslit by MIL and EH the whole time.

loveoflyla,"So, I have bipolar disorder and am in remission, I also have PTSD.. nothing ever cured my bipolar depression and eventually I quit medication and it sort of went away. The same thing happened to my father, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder then later diagnosed with depression that was situational. It was kind of expected that I'd get PPD. It is a bit weird though, my depression didn't start until about five days ago after my husband had a bad day at work and took it out on me. Nothing physically violent but he was so angry. He was on a work trip and I had forgotten to call him since I was sleep deprived from my baby cluster feeding at the time. I also didn't inform him that my parents and I went to my grandma's house with the baby and I guess he felt extremely angry that I didn't keep him in the loop.

We were going through a rough time and she didn’t feel I was giving her the love I need. I had some unaddressed mental issues I was struggling with (PTSD and anxiety) from my years in the military and from my current job as an LEO. I had recently stepped up and was doing a lot better with the baby and the other three children. My girlfriend wrote me a 5 page letter saying how proud she was and how she wanted us to work on things and go to therapy together and give ourselves a happy life. I had a week long training event out of town so I didn’t see her in person from when she sent the letter till the day I returned home from training. That night she got off work around 11pm and walked out. Just like that. She’s been gone for almost a month now and has refused to talk to me one on one about what’s going on. She’s been working constantly and picking up extra shifts and when she does have days off she goes out of town with friends.

lanalou1313,"I've been a mum for 1961 days today. 

On Boxing Day 2015, my[My first days in the motherhood](https://imgur.com/gallery/nN2WaIb) little diva came squealing into my world, changing everything forever. During my pregnancy, I'd known that she was medically complex, and that she would need indefinite time in hospital/s and at least one surgery on her heart (she ended up having two, six weeks apart). I'd known that she had down syndrome, I'd known since 13 weeks into my pregnancy. I'd known that I'd be doing it as a single parent, solely responsible for this little life I was growing inside me. 

What I didn't know, and what I wish I'd known, was how difficult those first few months were going to be. It started the night she was born. I had an emergency c-section, and it was hands down one of the most surreal experiences of my life. I could feel pulling and tugging, and a sort of 'schlooop' feeling when they pulled her out, and then the most amazingly beautiful and heartbreaking squeal I've ever heard in my life. This first picture in this collage is the first time I saw her, she was so small and pink. Her lips kept puckering up like a little rosebud. I didn't get to hold her that first night, she was too fragile and needed to kept very warm. The second picture is one my brother took as the nurses were wheeling her past him to the PICU, one he texted to me right away. Not being able to hold her that first night was very hard. It felt unreal, like I was an imposter, who hadn't just given birth to her first, her only, child. The nurse I had that night was a saint. He was funny, caring, and so good at his job. I can't even remember his name or what he looked like (which is interesting, because he had his hands on my nipples more than anyone before, or since). The third photo is about 12 hours post birth, finally getting to hold her, to look at her properly, for the first time. The love and fear that welled up in those first few minutes has never left my body since. They are eternally linked in a leaderless dance, whirling together at the forefront of my feelings for my daughter. The last picture is one a good friend took, catching me at a moment when I was trying to articulate how I felt - love, overwhelming all consuming love, and fear. Terror, in fact - that I'd be a terrible mum and a let down to my beautiful Alice. 

It took me a solid six months to bond with my daughter after she was born. Sure, I was there, I was at the hospital as often a I could be. I was there, at meetings with doctors, nurses, social workers, nameless faceless masses all wanting a piece of me. Or a piece of Alice. I was taking pictures, I was gushing on social media about her, I was saying all the right things. But inside, there was a disconnect. I held her as little as possible, at the time telling myself it was because I didn't want to disturb her monitoring equipment. I would let the professional cuddlers do the hard work of comforting, connecting, with her. I would let her cry, waiting for the nurses to come in and comfort her. There was a time when I couldn't look back on those first few months without an immense sense of shame and guilt. I've come to realise that, after a life of protecting myself, my emotions, out of necessity, my mind (brain? Subconscious?) had created a wall between me and the source of the greatest fear in my life: my daughter. I faked my way through this first few months, through her wins and losses. Her surgeries. She had two open heart surgeries, the first of which was when she was only 6 weeks old - only one week past her due date. This first surgery was a stop-gap, an attempt to buy more time before the big surgery was necessary. It didn't work. The second surgery, the make or break procedure to get her heart and lungs functioning properly, was done to her when she was 13 weeks old. She weighed just 5.5kg, her heart was the size of a walnut. I remember very little of that day, save for the phone call from her surgeon telling me that the surgery was successful. Beyond the first ten seconds of that call, I remember nothing. 

Once she started recovering from the second operation, it was like a switch had been flicked inside me. I was allowed to love her now, I was allowed to let her in. In the snare of tangled vines connecting emotion to action, my brain hadn't allowed me to fully love her because of the fear of losing her. That, illogically, if I loved her less then it would hurt less if she died. It's taken me some time to come to terms with my actions and emotions those first few months, and a lot of hours with my psychologist to heal the wounds left by my guilt. 

This was my personal brand of post partum depression and anxiety. It manifests differently for everyone, triggered by things not always easily understood. For me, connecting with my girl will be a lifelong effort on my part. A lifelong commitment to engage with her and allow her love to flow through me. I'm a solitary person by nature, and don't easily let people past my galvanized, fortified walls. She seems to knock them down fairly effortlessly these days, for which I am entirely, and overwhelmingly, grateful.

mompostpartum,"My birth was traumatic to say the least... but I’ll do my best to keep it short. I was in labor for about 24 hours and I pushed for over 3 while my baby had been in distress for around 8 hours of my labor and the duration of pushing. So once we decided an emergency c-section was necessary I was relieved to have my baby here and safe. He was stuck and they had to go up into the vaginal cavity and push him out the incision. He came out not crying &amp; blue and it was the longest 2 minutes of my entire life waiting to hear that cry while they suctioned him and flipped him around trying to get him breathing. After all of that I was just glad he was finally here. 5 days postpartum I had a fever, chills and my incision was red and puffy. I went to the emergency department and was told I had an infection and was septic, they admitted me immediately for intense iv antibiotics after 36 hours of antibiotics and no improvement and some allergic reactions they decided to open me again and remove the infection by scraping it out of my abdomen. 3 days post surgery I was sent home and my husband had to return to work the next day. During the 3 weeks after I had to return to the emergency department 3 more times cause the incision was reopening and gaping in on spot. When my baby was 5 weeks my grandmother had to get surgery (she was terminally ill with liver disease) the surgery didn’t go as planned... she bled and needed a transfusion. She was in icu and her kidneys weren’t functioning at the right percentage and she was combative with nurses and heavily sedated. She wasn’t expected to live and was VERY uncomfortable. She came home on hospice and passed 2 days later. My husband wasn’t very helpful around the house and I feel like I didn’t get to grieve cause I had to do everything without any help or support.

She died during childbirth, giving birth to a boy who has now grown into a man. To say we were best friends is an understatement, and...he got me pregnant, fathering my own children.

How much more wrong could I possibly be in my thoughts of what I would be as a mother?
I knew I should never have a child. I knew that I should never have a child but I went and did it anyway and now look at all of the pain, look at all of the suffering I have caused.

I always knew I was too sensitive, too wrapped up in my own issues, too mentally unhealthy and emotionally retarded to have a child. I didn’t want them to inherit my suffering. I knew that I should never have a child, it wouldn’t be fair on them.

And now here I am, I somehow managed to convince myself that I could do it and that it would be nice and fine. I convinced myself I could be a mother. Hahahaha. What a fucking joke!

I’m nothing, I’m nothing but a selfish vacuum that brings pain and hurt to all of those things that are near her. 

And now my baby, who never asked to be brought here, who never asked to have all of this happen screams at me. He stares me right in the eyes as he screams at me: “why the hell did you bring me here, you monster!?” I can see the pain in his face, see the fear in his eyes, feel the suffering, his soul is on fire, he is burning thanks to me.

Before I had a baby I knew that I was sensitive to noise. I didn’t know that the sound of my baby screaming would shoot like hot lightning through my brain and down the back of my neck either paralysing me or sending me into blackout rage. I didn’t know the sound of my baby crying would make me want to gouge out my eyes and stab myself in the wrists or walk off a ledge. I didn’t know that the sound of my baby crying would reverberate through my whole body, punching me over and over again in the guts: “why did you do this?”, “you knew you shouldn’t have done this!”, “look what you’ve done you fucking idiot, look at my suffering!” 

I never knew that I would be screaming along with my baby in the darkest hours of night, I didn’t know I would be pulling him close and telling him I hate him, telling him I’m going to fucking kill him. He is being punished, he is being blamed for all of MY mistakes, like it’s somehow his fault that he cries, like it’s somehow his fault that I don’t know how to do this.

He did nothing, he did nothing to deserve this. He did nothing to deserve copping me for a mum.

Then she had such high levels of jaundice that we were admitted to the children’s hospital ER several times.

I get so overwhelmeded when my baby cries, I’m a first time mom so I’m still learning all the baby actions and cries. I lose so much sleep and that obviously doesn’t help with depression. 

Overall I feel like I do so much for everybody and nobody does anything for me. I sell my personal belongings when we are low on money to support my family and I never get anything in return. For once I want someone to say I’m doing a good job. 

Does this ever get better overtime? I’m seeing a counselor so hopefully that can help a little bit but I just wanna know who has gone through this and does it get better?",Postpartum_Depression,Feeling alone.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/nf032e/feeling_alone/,1621333905.0,2021-05-18 03:31:45,6.514555337691099e+18

nosihctuhalya,"i should preface this entire post with saying i didnt want a second baby to begin with. i was 100% content with my 6.5 month old at the time when i found out i was pregnant again. 
i was already diagnosed with postpartum depression about a week ago by a psychiatrist. im now seeing a therapist for the 1st time next week. ive just been struggling super hard with bonding and to even just like my daughter in general. i know that sounds horrible but ill explain 

so my son was born jan 2020. hes almost 16 mons currently. my experience delivering him was the most traumatic thing ive ever gone thru to date. he was 10 lbs, gave me 4th degree tears and needed 4 blood transfusions. however he had no issues upon arrival and was placed directly into my arms and he's been breastfed pretty much every day since. it was like love at first site for us.

my daughter was born march 2021 (due april) my water broke with her way to early and the dr at my local hospital had me transferred to a bigger hospital with a NICU. she was born and was having issues breathing on her own and regulating her own sugars so she stayed in there for a week. i didnt even get to hold her til she was 3-4 days old. it was awful. 

so now im paying the price for that nicu visit. i feel like shes someone elses baby and im just the long term babysitter. i literally dread waking up to feed her, holding her, listening to her coos. all of that stuff makes me unimaginably angry? my therapist is supposed to work with me threw that and the mom guilt of taking attention away from my son too early. 

i just need to know if its normal to not like or wanna hold your baby. i experienced the opposite of this problem with my son. i could never put him down or let him cry. he was exclusively breastfed for nearly 14 mons. i didnt even wanna pump or latch her. which struck me as weird bc i was so against giving my son formula. a week after my daughter came home she was pretty much only on formula, i stopped pumping and latching her cuz i didnt wanna hold her. 

i guess im just looking for support and honesty. i am struggling and just need to not feel so alone.",Postpartum_Depression,struggling to bond w/ infant,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/ngxfvm/struggling_to_bond_w_infant/,1621534503.0,2021-05-20 11:15:03,4.966100671441108e+18

incognito536,"I have a 2 year old son and I was diagnosed with PPD/PPR at 6 months postpartum. My son can be downright rotten. I know, I know, it’s the terrible 2’s, but he’s been like this since birth. I often say (and truly believe) that my son is the most difficult child to ever be conceived. As a baby, he cried for hours every day. Couldn’t be put down for even a second. Needed constant stimulation. Nursed constantly. Never slept. He was up 6-10 times a night until we finally sleep trained at 13 months. And even now, he sometimes screams for hours before falling asleep at night, and per our pediatrician’s advice, we let him. He’s broken me entirely.

He doesn’t do anything. Can’t drive 10 minutes down the road to the grocery store (to the point that I’ve been off my depression meds for over a week because I can’t get to the store to pick up the refill; he won’t tolerate the ride there). Refuses to eat (gets angry when we put food on his plate and angrily throws it all at me/around the room). Won’t tolerate the wagon or the stroller. Refuses to play (just throws his toys at me in anger). Shows no affection whatsoever. Spends all day hitting, slapping, scratching, pulling hair and screaming. We’ve taken him to every specialist under the sun and he’s perfectly healthy, but I’m losing my grip.

I feel genuine hatred for my child. I’m completely miserable, and spiraling out of control. On a regular basis, I tell my husband (while my child is within earshot) that my son makes me miserable. That if something happened to him and I didn’t have to deal with him anymore, it wouldn’t be all bad because at least I’d get my life back. That I hate my child. And today, I grabbed his arm and yelled at him to stop screaming and crying and just be a normal kid. I was not nice about it. Sometimes, I put him on the ground too roughly after a bout of slapping and scratching. All I do is yell and cry. I’m terrified I’m abusing my child both emotionally and physically.

I’m currently seeing multiple therapists. I’ve been on every medication and combination of medications you could possibly think of, and nothing is getting better. Things are only getting much worse. I don’t know what to do anymore. My child is miserable and mean, but he deserves better. I grew up in an abusive home and I promised myself I’d do better. I’d be a gentle parent. But he’s broken me and I’ve lost myself entirely. What do I do? Do I tell someone he’s being abused and let them take him away? I want him to be happy and safe. I love him and I want better for him.

boo-pspps,"I was induced at 38 weeks, my baby girl wasn’t growing. She ended up being in the posterior position so I had to get forceps. It was a medium traumatic experience. 

But my milk came late and when we were in hospital I had nothing to give her, we had to give her formula. I felt like a failure. When she would cry cry cry at night I would say to my husband “let’s leave her here”. I said it as a joke but I knew deep down I was serious. I felt worse… 

When I left the hospital I went to stay with my parents who kindly offered to help. My husband is a gold star husband who does everything he can to make things easier for me. But I was sad all the time, I felt like a bad mum because I didn’t have enough milk to feed her. I was sleep deprived all the time, I was exhausted. 

My husband noticed this and he held me as I cried and said to me I should call my doctor and talk to her about how I was feeling. He knew something was wrong. I was like a different person. The strong independent woman he married was nowhere to be seen. I was a mess! But I ignored him. 

A few more weeks in I found myself crying everyday. My mum saw me one day and asked me “what do you have to be sad about? You have a great husband, a healthy baby. Don’t be so negative.” 

That night i cried myself to sleep. I woke at 3 am to feed. After hubby helped me feed our little baby girl I found myself thinking about packing a bag and just leaving. I didn’t feel like I was worthy to be a mum, and my hubby and baby would be better off without me. In that moment something triggered in my brain I realised something was very wrong. In a moment of clarity my normal self took over and made a booking online to talk to my GP. She diagnosed me with a mild case of PND. 

This was 2 months ago. 
I still struggle sometimes. Ive begged my husband through tears and screams to let me go. I’ve begged him to find our baby a new mum, a better mum, someone who could care for her. The whole time he would hold me and say to me gently but firmly i am the best mum for our baby. Sometimes his voice would cut through the depression, other times it doesn’t. 

I am improving though, finding things that helps me manage my symptoms. Im not on any medication yet, but im learning to talk about it with friends. I find talking about really helps me. I don’t tell my parents about it because they don’t understand depression. 

Most of the time though I feel guilty about having postnatal depression…. 

I have a wonderful and supportive husband who is an amazing dad, very hands on. My baby girl is growing and every medical professional we have seen have commented on how healthy she is. I have a good job, my work has paid parental leave, my husband also gets paid parental leave. My managers at work have given me all the power to decide when I return to work and how flexibly I want to work when I’m ready. 

What do I have to be sad about?? I should be happy, but I’m not. Im grateful for what I have I truly am. But sometimes I feel so guilty for feeling sad because I really have no reason to.

Erbear1,"I am already in therapy, and have been seeing my therapist for general depression since before I was pregnant with my son (18 months old). I am also on 100mg of zoloft per day. I don't feel as though my depression has gotten any better, only that I'm managing.

gdalpezzo,"TL;DR: Just read the first and last paragraph if you don't want to read everything, it's a long post. Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile and this is my first post here.

I don't have any friends and my SO is normally very supportive and a great partner but ever since my third trimester I've felt very alone in dealing with my pregnancy, labor, and now with taking care of my baby. 

I had extreme back pain and muscle spasms during my third trimester, so bad I had to stop working around 34 weeks pregnant. But even though it was extremely painful for me to walk or do any physical activity, I was still expected to do everything I did before (plus some, since now I was off work and therefore had more free time). I had to keep up with the grocery shopping, carrying the groceries upstairs to our second floor apartment without help, cooking, packing SO's lunch for work, cleaning the house, dishes, laundry, etc. 

I went to the hospital May 10th to induce labor. I have horrible anxiety, especially around doctors and hospitals. My labor was really scary since this is my first baby and I was in labor for 24 hours. They almost did an emergency c-section, even had me sign all the paperwork because they were so sure they were going to have to do a c-section. I was awake all night unable to sleep because I was so scared and nervous. SO was asleep for most of it, and on his phone most of the time he wasn't sleeping. I was in charge of updating friends and family members about what was going on, and after our son was born I was still in charge of updates, pictures, etc for my parents, his parents, our friends, Facebook, you name it. I felt like I didn't get much of a chance to just enjoy my son.

After we came home from the hospital, I was told not to lift or carry anything heavier than my baby. I was told to take it easy, and not overdo it. Basically, just take care of the baby and myself and that's it. I wanted to listen to the doctor's advice, but that hasn't happened yet. Ever since the day we came home, I've had to go back to my regular activity from before giving birth. All the housework, cooking, etc plus keeping all friends and family updated. My son is the first grandchild on both mine and my SO's side of the family, and everyone wanted pictures and info and I was to do it all. I was and still am bleeding too much, definitely wasn't getting a chance to shower as often as I should and keep my stitches clean, hell I barely have time to change out my pad or go pee when I need to. I went to the store the day I came home from the hospital, 3 days after giving birth, because we needed formula and I'm the one in charge of doing the shopping. 

So, needless to say, I'm beyond overwhelmed and stressed out. I have major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis (my psychiatrist is working with me to figure out exactly what it is but I hear voices in my head 24/7) and they warned me I'd probably have PPD after I had my son. I'm definitely feeling like I have it but I also don't know who I can talk to. I haven't started talk therapy yet, don't have any friends, and for a few months now I haven't been able to talk to my partner about how I feel without regretting it. 

I need tips on how to handle post partum depression by myself. What can I do that doesn't involve reaching out to a friend or family member, since that's not really an option for me? What can I do to take care of myself when I have a never ending to-do list and no time to eat or pee much less do any form of self-care? I feel like I'm drowning and really need some advice.

Sndzc,"Hello everyone, I've been reading some stories and I will share mind as I think I need some help.

I am gonna try to keep this short but there is a lot. My now husband and I met overseas and we are from two different countries (France and US). After two years in the country we met we had to leave pretty quickly for private reasons (it was quite traumatic). Before the move we had a few hard months, suffered a miscarriage while being away from friends and family and I lost a lot of weight because of stress and anxiety (I have been struggling with my body and eating habits since being a teenager).

We made it back to each other countries and I visited him while waiting for my visa to move permanently to the US. After almost a year and being few weeks away from my visa interview, we decided to try for a baby so I can be pregnant and not work (and hopefully relax) during the full pregnancy and the first few months of the baby as it will take a while to get my work authorization. The plan was good on paper but covid happened, my interview was 3 days after the world went in full lockdown and it got cancelled. So here I am pregnant, in lockdown by myself thinking it will be only for a little bit. During the lockdown my mom sold her apartment I was living at and didnt really care where I will end up (she had her life going on in Portugal and didnt even bothered to come for the move). Luckily, my grand ma whom I am very close to still has the big family house and I moved there along with my cousin. I spend a ""relaxing"" spring and summer there with them but as I was going closer to my due date I was starting to get very anxious my partner will not be able to make it on time. Luckily he was working remotely and his company was nice enough to let him travel and work from France from September (after almost 24h of travel because of so many restrictions to enter France). We got to enjoy a month of getting ready for our baby in our rental and life felt normal again. However we knew that shortly after the birth we will have to get all the paperwork for me and our baby to be able to fly home to the US. And we did, one week after birth (which was a non scheduled home birth, baby girl was excited to meet us!), traveled to Paris to take care of passport and visa. I had to do a medical for my visa and the doctor checked my weight and nicely told me that I had ""a long way to go"" before being back to my pre pregancy weight(remember the body image issues I mentioned ? It was very helpful). Anyways, we are finally on our way after a stressful month as I needed to take care of many other paperwork as I was leaving my country, packing, nursing my baby, lack of sleep etc etc.

Once in the US, we moved into my partner's apartment (1 bed 1 bath) and for a month or so we are still busy with paperwork, unpacking etc. My visa was linked to us getting married so we did got married in December but because of COVID it was only my in laws, our baby girl at the city office (not really the wedding of my dreams). We were supposed to have our religious wedding this summer in France but this got cancelled because of covid too.

January to March has been very hard. I had ups and downs with breastfeeding (reynaud's disease and a lot of pain), couldnt manage to loose any weight, was over tired, felt very isolated because I have no friends and family around + covid so no outlets to meet new people (my dad couldn't even meet his first granddaughter because we had to leave France so quickly). I found myself somedays just sleeping all day long and waking up only to feed our daughter. I felt I was failing her as mom as I was mostly a robot. My husband was trying to help but he is not naturally proactive and it was starting to be too much for me to have to think about everything for the family.

After 4 months in our cave (the place had no light, my husband worked from our living room and i had basically no space to be), we finally moved to a bright and sunny place with two bedrooms. We were thinking this will help me a lot because now I have natural light, a space for my indoor bike so I can workout more consistently, etc etc. However, it has been now a month in the new place and I find myself still not feeling normal if I can say so. The body acception part of postpartum is super super hard for me. My marriage pictures are one month postpartum and I just can't look at it. Even yesterday's picture taken at a family gathering are so hard for me to look at because I just don't look like myself. I went to have a haircut to refresh my look and take care of myself but even that made me feel worst as I didn't recognise myself. I am trying to take it easy but I just feel it has been too much for the last two years. I try to talk to my doctor at my postpartum check here in the US but I just couldn't say a word, I had tears in my eyes but just couldn't talk. I felt I was doing better but I will find myself breaking down for minor things and I cannot take any pressure anymore.

At yesterday's gathering, I just felt i didn't belong there, had nothing to talk about, not even mentioning people asking about a second child when my first is only 7 months (I initially wanted a big family but this post partum phase is a huge setback for me).

I want to talk to psychiatrist but I am afraid to be put on meds but at the same time I feel I need something to help my brain relax for a little. I feel my husband is worried for me and afraid I will just leave them or breakdown because it is just too much for me.

hardlysleepy,"Hi, new poster
My english is bad sorry. I'm just lazy.
Anyways. I have a 3 1/2 month old baby girl who adores me. She was born a preemie. And a badass 2 month old toddler who makes so much mess through the day. Especially with food like c'mon man. 
I'm a work from home mom with dad working out of town monday- saturday. It's been 3 weeks of this and he lowkey wants to make it into more. Whatever the deal is. I am very suddenly and severely declining in my depression and delusional thoughts. I am bipolar II with psychosis and anxiety. Anyways
I've been stuck in an endless loop of depressive thoughts that trace back to my self hate inflicted coming from a household with plenty mental issues then the gap between then and now feels non existential, y'all get it. 
I find being alone a trigger. I feel so empty in every way. 
Like everything had a meaning, but then no meaning at all. Whatsoever.
No emotional attachment to things I enjoy and cherish when my husbands home. Everything is just particles.  I lose sense of time sometimes I even forget I have kids or a job. I forget who I am. How I look. Every time I look at myself I see different features. I forget to eat. I impulsively deleted all my social media I mean I didn't have any friends either. I don't like to feel people developing a friendship with me. I've stayed in the same apartment 3 weeks and it feels like I'm in a mental hospital. Constantly having flashbacks of all my times institutionalized. Mostly of my younger years where I would go to same ward and I was put in empty room with a camera. I honestly feel like I died and I'm a tumbleweed somewhere in a desert. I honestly don't even know how I'm performing hygiene on me and the kids and feeding time for them. Please don't grow concern they are great. I only have concern for my health.  And want to express my abstract thoughts.",Postpartum_Depression,Constant emptiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/nkmylm/constant_emptiness/,1621965548.0,2021-05-25 10:59:08,8.666529369217266e+18
pampams44,"I'm currently sitting here waiting to leave for work and for my MIL to pick my baby up for the day and I am staring at her and thinking how much I love her, and how beautiful she is and how I can't wait to see her later after work. 

I didn't feel like this the first month and half. I couldn't wait to go back to work because of how stressed and depressed I was being home alone with the baby. Now, all I want is to be around her. She's older now and calmer, only 11 weeks old, but still I don't feel as desperate as I had when she does get fussy. This is all because I have been on zoloft for a few weeks now and have been getting help from family. I stayed with my MIL for two weeks straight recently. All of this has been helping me fight postpartum depression. And because I am fighting it, I see how much I actually love being her mommy and love being around her. Postpartum depression made me think I made a mistake, that I wasn't cut out for this but I am. And I didn't make a mistake, she's the best thing that ever happened to me.

RubyRain05,"Feeling isolated even in a house full of people. My husband wfh, my mom is retired and my dad still works, then theres me SAHM, and baby.

I've attempted to sleep train and we are good at bedtime but MOTN have been difficult. We try different things then shes back to waking and not going back to sleep. Husband has been waking to put her back to sleep so I can rest but it's not working well. He weaned her cold turkey from night feeds and it's like shes still fighting for it 3 weeks later. So instead of me resting I still have to go in and help sometimes.

Tonight she cried for almost 2 hours until my husband had to get ready for work and I had to step in. I couldn't get her to sleep but she was finally calm so I put her down like bedtime and left and 1 min later she started crying. Now everyone came after ME for it. I've told everyone countless times why I want to let her CIO at night but they say no because they can't hear her cry and need sleep and its cruel....how is that any different than now. 

I go into a rage when I'm sleep deprived and they all come at me at once at 4 am about what is wrong with ST. All day I'm with her and I'm expected to be up all night too and keep the house clean. My mom is sick so she spends most of the day sleeping or in pain. Husband works but then gets upset if I leave her with him to long right after work plus he insists on his early 6:30 bedtime in order wake at 4am with her. I'm exhausted and trying so hard to keep my energy up for her shes 12m. But I need more support from the people around me..they might as well not be there. I feel like a piece of crap that no one cares about. 

A big thing contributing to my depression is I did get my wfh dream job 4 months pp but it only lasted 4 months and I feel like I failed. They didn't say the problem was me (although I suspect they legally weren't allowed to becaus I was a new mom) and I just wish I would have had better support and regret so many things I did while working distracted. What hurts more is when I asked for MOTN help when I was working my husband refused. And now he wants to complain to me about being tired and working....yea I know....🙄. Adding salt to the wound is him saying I'm not emotionally meeting her needs especially because I want to sleep train. This guy told me 10 days PP that I wasn't doing enough for her because I was trying to split the night with him so I can sleep at 8 and jump in for the early wakes! He was on paternity leave so what's the problem with that??! 

I just want the saga to end! I'm tired of explaining myself and not being respected because it's not just about me so I guess I have no say. I had to scream.at them to leave me.alone.

nosihctuhalya,"I posted in here awhile ago about struggling to bond with my daughter. shes two months old, not getting any better. still dont wanna hold her, touch her, hear her cry, feed her, etc. its SO awful. i hate this so much. I immediately bonded with my son. Love at first site, literally. Breastfed most of his life (still nursing at 16 mons) and we've bedshared since he was born. Its making me question who I am as a mother? How can I be a good parent to one of my babies, and literally not wanna touch the other one???? 

anyways the real reason im making this post is, im worried im gonna traumatize my daughter and that shes gonna pick up on my feelings for her. i know shes a little baby soon &amp; im really really hoping this goes away before she can form sentences and pays attention to what im saying. 

my mom didnt like me either as a kid, she would tell me all the time. I was so excited to be having a girl to finally break the curse in my family of mothers not liking their daughters. i know i still struggle as an adult with the kinds of things my mom said to me or did to me as a child &amp; i would never ever wanna put someone else let alone MY BABY through that kind of stuff.

rubymars17,"I’m a new mom almost 4 months pp. Recently has been diagnosed with PPA and moderate PPD by a psychiatrist. I love my baby so so much. When she smiles, I smile. But I just don’t feel happy anymore. I was a very happy person before, a lot of things can easily lighten my mood up(e.g. a good meal, a nice TV show, video games). Now Almost nothing can lighten my mood up. ......I constantly feel like a loser. I keep questioning myself more and more. And everything is triggering my anxiety. I’ve been cutting off social media for about two weeks. Because when I see other people traveling doing yoga living their lives. I get anxiety. Even watching YouTube videos I used to enjoy gives me anxiety as well. I just feel this constant emptiness. I don’t get it. Why. 

Dancing was one of my hobbies before pregnancy. But now I have this leg pain PP so I couldn’t dance. I’m going to physical therapy every week. The PT said it’s normal and it will heal. But I’m just worried too much and I ask her every week “will I get better will I get better?”. This triggers my anxiety as well.

Sometimes even a message from my friend triggers my anxiety. So I have this friend who is a workaholic keeps messaging me about her feelings, her pressure doing her job and etc. I know she is my friend and I should be supportive but all I want to say is will you just shut up! Being a new mom is hard enough and I really can’t deal with her negativity so I basically muted her since last week.

My husband has been so solid and has picked up all the slack, in addition to still working. I feel so useless and sorry. I feel helpless to my baby. 

She was generally doing amazing until last night. Things suddenly took a turn for the worst. Now we’re both back at square 1.

It wasn’t a planned pregnancy, and her dad (25m) wanted me to get an abortion. I told him I couldn’t do that but gave him the option to walk away. He said he wanted to stay and make things work. My whole pregnancy he would party every weekend, sometimes we would be out until 4 or 5 am. He would do a lot of drugs (mostly c0caine) and would lie and hide it. There was a point during my pregnancy where he was doing it every day. To say the least, I had a very difficult pregnancy. I ended up going into labour early and had to have an emergency c-section. So now I’m left with this huge scar and belly fat that won’t go away, oh and the saggy boobs. Anyway, since our daughter was born - he actually quit his drug addiction.... but since he has such an addictive personality it’s now switched to being addicted to fishing and hunting. Which don’t get me wrong - I would much rather prefer. But now all his time and money go to fishing and hunting. He hates being with us and always asks if he can go away for the weekend to go fishing or whatever. I let him go almost every night after our daughter goes to bed.

hhhhhhhillary,"I’ve posted here a couple times in the last month or so, and things are not getting better. My doctor prescribed Zoloft a month ago, and if anything, things have gotten worse. I have a follow up appointment tomorrow. 

Anyways, I feel like this pit of PPD that I am in is putting a huge strain on my (29F) relationship with my partner (35M). He is always asking how he can help, and I just shut him out. He tries to make plans, either just with me or with me and the kids (6M &amp; 3moF), and most of the time I either shut him down in the first place or end up not wanting to go at the last minute. He offers to watch the kids so I can go do anything I want, but the only time I take him up is to go running or to a barre class. I don’t have any desire to do anything social with or without him. 

Even at home, he will cook dinner and then want to watch a movie together, and I have no desire to do that either. Every day it’s like I’m counting down the minutes until I can go back to sleep. Sleep is pretty much the only thing I enjoy these days. 

He is trying so incredibly hard, and I just feel compulsions to push him away every time. To be fair, I’ve been pushing friends and family away as well, but not to the same extent because I don’t live or coparent with any of them. 

Recently I haven’t even wanted to hug or kiss him, let alone be intimate. The only time I’ve felt affectionate is when his friend died and I was comforting him; I’m not receptive to being the one who needs comforting. 

I don’t know what to do because I feel like my entire personality has changed. He’s been an amazing parent and partner through everything and I don’t want to ruin our relationship. Before PPD, we never fought more than the occasional bicker and I was a lot more social and enjoyed doing things with him and as a family.

Visible_Research021,"I am just posting to get a good vent out into the world. I am postpartum 5 months and I feel like the first two months I was doing okay. Healing, getting used to having a baby, and finishing classes to apply to nursing school. (Which I actually got accepted) Until I really came to the realization that my husband wasn't helping at all. I guess I was in a blur for a while just feeding, sleeping, and doing homework. I had her on Feb 2nd and started classes March 15th or so. My husband was in graduate school for Ceramics and finishing his last year. I kept saying... oh he is finishing a graduate degree things will get better. At her 4 month mark.... I broke. I screamed, yelled, cried, and officially lost it on him for not helping. He still wakes up and does all the things he wants to do. He will change diapers and feed her when I ask but there is 0 initiative. Literally wakes up, plays videos games for 40 minutes, and makes sure he gets a 45 minute work out in every day. When literally I'm just struggling to find the motivation to shower after making sure she is taken care of. As of last week my doctor gave me some meds to help with the PPD but I feel like he is contributing to it. I have gone to lunch with friends twice and he watched her. I come home and he is playing videos games while she is in her little kick chair or her bouncer. I just find it to be offensive because I try so hard to engage her, tummy time her, and make sure she is getting the stimulation needed for proper development.

We got into a fight just now and i am starting to loathe myself. I think i am not allowed to voice out any of my concerns or opinions. Like it is wrong to be upset that i failed to understand what we talked about yesterday with him meeting his friend. I let my guard down and apologized for acting poorly and for not being to understand where he told me he really was. He cstarted calling me names and cussed at me yet again. Just like how he has been throughout my entire pregnancy.

I know that i am stupid, but i am strating to believe that i am. I lost my child less than 7 weeks ago and me going back to my place alone is harder than i could imagine i wish i could talk to someone.

Lucha_Dora,"Hi mamas. I’m hoping I’m posting in the correct subreddit. 

I’d like to thank everyone is advance for taking time while you are going through all the emotions of motherhood and reading my story and sharing your experiences. Thank you ❤️

Quick background: I have a 4 yr old daughter who is my absolute pride and joy. The connection she and I have means everything and she is just absolutely awesome; smart, funny, loving… I feel so lucky to be her mama. 
We are having some issues since coming home from the hospital with my, now, 1 week old son. I feel like I’m witnessing her struggle with her feelings. She is desperate for my attention and though I try as hard as I can to give it to her, I have a newborn who needs a lot of attention, as they do, and attention of a different kind. 
I suffered PPD with my daughter. It took months to get everything settled and, ultimately, I was put on medication and it was immensely helpful. I’ve also been in therapy for many years. I’ve continued on medication knowing that I am susceptible to PPD and though I feel “ok” this time, I find myself struggling with my daughter. My anxiety kicks in when she comes home from school and things are triggering her quickly (for instance: I lost a nipple shield and she cried bc she couldn’t help me find it - I had found it before her. She was inconsolable). It’s jarring to watch her burst into tears unprovoked because she’s not a tantrum kid, she’s always been so “chill”. My anxiety has me feeling like I did something bad by having her brother and it’s going to put a rift between us. 
My husband is an incredible support system, my therapist has checked in with me daily, and my medications are on board, but I’m still feeling lost, anxious, sad, and -ugh, I hate saying this aloud- regretting having a second kiddo. I love my son. I love that I get “the set” (my boy and girl) and this is most definitely my last pregnancy (I suffered complications throughout this pregnancy). I never realized how much being a mom has made me into a better version of me and here I am with double the love. 

I hope I am conveying what I mean and I’m looking forward to hearing from all of you. 

Does it get easier with multiple kids? Did you keep your dynamic with your eldest? Any pointers to help meld these two worlds so things are smoother??

urimandu,"TLDR; a looooong-time friend broke up with me and i feel so conflicted. 

This last few months I’ve been slowly recovering from post partum depression and generally just working through so many new feelings and inner knots. I am proud to say that through it all I’ve been a good (enough) mother, a good (enough) wife, but i could definitely have been a better friend. One friend and I have been in and out of friendship since we were babies. We had times where we were really close and did a lot together, and other times where we drifted apart with other interests and life goals. There were times we were able to support each other through difficult times, there were times where we caused each other some difficult times. On the brink of the friendship breaking, I always fought for it and we recommitted and still connected. Since a couple of years, i had been growing less and less invested in an attempt to shield myself (generally). I had been growing less comfortable with her, as she sometimes comes across manipulative or judgmental, because she seeks out honesty. I don’t live in our home country anymore and due to the pandemic i basically decide very last minute whether i travel home for a weekend. I mentioned to her that i am planning to come a certain weekend and a week before this weekend she checks in with me whether i’m still coming. I check the number of incidents, which is high, and reply that i won’t come. She is upset and asking when i would have told her this. We didn’t set a clear appointment so i didn’t realize i had to update her. Plus i hadn’t consciously considered that i wasn’t going until her text. I apologized and she replied that she feels i disrespect her time and therefore herself. She wants to be understanding of my situation but she can’t if i don’t communicate it. I felt accused, misunderstood and generally just crappy for being a bad friend. I didn’t know what to write back and left it on read for a couple of days, trying to find a healthy way to digest it and reply. Before i could though, she wrote me again. She couldn’t do this anymore and felt guilty for being honest. Which she thinks is unfair in a friendship. So she wishes me well and says maybe we see each other coincidentally one day. This prompted me to finally reply and i could share something of what was going on with me. But i feel there is so much left unsaid. I mentioned maybe we could talk about this face to face one day.. but also generally wished her well. I feel so conflicted. Is this good? Is this freeing me? Is this evidence that i am a bad friend and not able to create deep relationships? Is it worth fighting for? Is it okay to just let this go? I’m weary and it feels like admitting a failure. That i’m a failure. Ugh, just need to vent this.

blueberryhill0722,"Hello all. I figured I'd take some time and write my first post here. What do I have to lose? I'm a FTM with a preemie. My son has now spent his first full week at home with my husband and I. And it's not what I pictured/dreamed about at all. I thought I would be more elated to have him home with us, given the 2 weeks he spent in the SCN after I was discharged. But I feel like I have no attachment or bonding with him. I am wondering if it is because he and I didn't get to spend the ""golden hour"" together after he was born. He was whisked away by doctors because he was 34 weeks, and needed to be assessed. I didn't get to hold him until the day after, and only did skin to skin twice since he's been born. I felt more of a connection with him when my husband and I would visit him after work when he was still hospitalized. 
My son is my rainbow baby, I miscarried last summer and I'm just not excited/happy to be around him. I never thought I'd feel this way. I'm wondering too, if there could be other factors contributing to this. My husband has one week off from work and goes back this Monday. I, myself, am on unpaid maternity leave because I didn't qualify to get paid leave through my state/job. I'm stressed out to the max and at this point, I feel like I'm my husband's assistant when it comes to caring for my son, instead of my son's mother.
I never pictured the start of motherhood like this. I plan on telling my OB all this at my 6 week appointment coming up.
I just don't want to let my son down and be a horrible/detached mother.
